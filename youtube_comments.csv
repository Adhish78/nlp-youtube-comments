UgxDjx9DXh_aYMqfKeJ4AaABAg,i bought fold 3 yesterday because of its way cheaper. its a good phone but any phone case looks bad with it

UgwsOiu_uADVKO7jjUZ4AaABAg,It sucks Android can&#39;t handle certain DJ app like DJay Pro AI I would switch from Iphone but Android has audio mixing latency issue which they haven&#39;t fixed since 15 years ago.
UgwoIURLQ4SNKo82Gzt4AaABAg,How much is the z fold 5?
UgxrdcsnoD2T93PKvYd4AaABAg,Almost the same as last year? I‚Äôd say Samsung pulled off an apple ;)
Ugx0UOSHrGg0tO6iEWJ4AaABAg,One still can&#39;t use the outer screen like a normal phone on the Flip ?!!
UgxGBcOZlM3iCpUAnZl4AaABAg,What&#39;s your opinion about the new legal battle between apple and wiltech from Colombia? @marquesbrownlee
Ugydt0ntEHxnlrHMrzx4AaABAg,It&#39;s <b>Fold4 --&gt; Fold6</b> for me
UgwH2wJ6-cE0KgvgMkF4AaABAg,"I&#39;m puzzled by the issue with the cover screen on the Z Fold 5 phone. If you (becasue you&#39;re reviewing from your point of view) finds it narrow and difficult and spends around 85% of your time using the cover screen, why opt for a folding phone in the first place? Choosing a regular phone is a straightforward solution. As for me, I will be using the larger screen most of the time. Not everyone has 20/20 vision and need a larger phone that the size can be reduce when closed."
Ugyb-IuXQ4JcQa_6lC14AaABAg,Wanna see the videos in English againüò¢
Ugz8sRIqM_I0M5FtV0Z4AaABAg,"Can not recommend until they fix the screen protector. It bubbled and pealed in the crease after half a year. Now a year after purchase, a centimeter tall crease is white and hard to see through, full of dust. And you cannot remove or replace this yourself, it voids the warranty."
Ugxcr3337R_lvCvEUzt4AaABAg,It is actually dubbed to Portugues here
Ugzv5hc7ttYYNbdlkj54AaABAg,I‚Äôm getting the Flip 5 for free on an upgrade. My Android is my secondary device so I expect it‚Äôll be around a few years.

Ugx12saoZbY3cvpcidh4AaABAg,I‚Äôm thinking bout switching my iPhone to this one Apple does the same crap every year smh
Ugzj_whm70XnQOY5CuB4AaABAg,I wish the fold was cheaper if the tech is getting better
UgwRSOCV-nNuG7YpYzB4AaABAg,"I hope you kee that same energy  when Apple releases the 15‚Äôs in September. Coming from an iPhone user since the OG in 2007.üòÆ Yes, I love apple for it‚Äôs ‚Äújust works well‚Äù OS, but damn it‚Äôs boring after we get the same thing over and over, each year. Samsung at least pushes innovation, and releases it, even when it‚Äôs not fully cooked, but hey it‚Äôs at least pushing boundaries. Apple has such a hold on people with iMessage and FaceTime in the United States. It works well and I like it but is it always going to be enough to keep peoples attention? We shall see"
UgxAPu_LwbhR_6bZ8q94AaABAg,damn what a disappointment the Flip 5!!

UgxWLZSOlZ4hZIvHtAR4AaABAg,Hats a pretty rad shirt. Whats the meaning behind it?
Ugzt5dQT71a7VnBszuJ4AaABAg,So like Apple ü§≠

Ugyz9tJIe8JRTk7WNzd4AaABAg,"With that tablet tag at the end, when will foldable tablets become more mainstream? Or am I just unaware? It seems like the logical use of the tech? Want a mini tablet for reading etc? And also a large tablet for media viewing? Boom foldable tablet."
UgxSbxQbUwK3kt_7c7h4AaABAg,"It is worth having these safe phones though - if all goes wrong with the market, at least we&#39;ll have a safe, reliable phone to use <br>I don&#39;t understand what i just said. This phone is boring üò¢"
Ugybhfepw6PwGeQxUFN4AaABAg,small upgrade from last year?
Ugyipq3aveMwcZR7dkx4AaABAg,waiting for an s9 ultra review
UgzBqkkZ5hVaBSiWxDJ4AaABAg,"I&#39;m curious on how the phones feel while you have them in your pocket. When going out or are at work, I wonder if the foldables are comfortable while stored in pockets. My S23 Ultra has no issue of comfortability, just because its so thin."
UgwFLmeVcNpA__JkOjh4AaABAg,"I don&#39;t like the bigger screens on the zflips. I mean, the point of the zflip is that I don&#39;t get distracted by my phone. But you can play simple app games on it now."
UgxchbEo5-sQVLA478x4AaABAg,I have the flip 3. Is it worth upgrading??
UgwHJyFNPJ239ApKzJd4AaABAg,"I get that you what to add other multilanguage options to your videos. But for me it&#39;s simple horrible, I speak pt from Portugal, and that robot like pt br that starts when I open one of your videos is simply horrible, English is fine for me. So I need to change every single video to English and in the reels didn&#39;t figure out where to do that. Extra step or one step to stop watching your videos."
UgxGejnw8LKB2g8p35J4AaABAg,I just wish they made it the size of a plus which folds out to a bigger .. so u get a normal phone size and a tablet in one
UgxW1kd8vutax8yiPTh4AaABAg,like your review i would purchase new phones and from the 70s until 2020 i have the old flips and other from the 70s thru 2020 so i have a collection samsung sony nokia motorolas  i now sercom to phones with 6.9 inch or higher size we now have a chose out their would like u to study the best cost to run those new phones like consumer cell verizon att mint and trac phone which i foung out verizon just purchase how is that going affect the high cost of running these phone or are the buy outs going to get rid of 15 to 25 amonth phone bills tks will be watching
UgyKq1T70FoIeAY92bl4AaABAg,You should review the honor magic v2 foldable
UgyHyyAlkNa1sp8GpdN4AaABAg,I like how no ones says shit when android manufacturers release LITERALLY the same phone again but the second apple does it they are the loudest ones to talk.
UgyT17kUncmM7eTticp4AaABAg,I was planning to get the fold but then when I saw the differences between the 4 and 5 I changed my mind. I&#39;d probably wait for a new vivo fold since they don&#39;t shy away from high end performance like fast charging and not include trash CPUs like exynos
UgwnVCJ1A7SObKNMzSp4AaABAg,"I had a flip 3. The battery life, charging speed and camera were all terrible, so i held out from upgrading to the flip 4 and instead got an ultra. Now I&#39;m disappointed to see its basically the same story with the flip and fold 5. Guess I&#39;ll wait foe the flip fold 6 and see if they actually push the envelope"
UgxomsOVvOPH47uTdXx4AaABAg,"MKBHD... If something doesn&#39;t need to be re-engineered or fixed, then it shouldn&#39;t be FIXED. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

UgwWV1BjjMcEZM39WVp4AaABAg,"Now that the Flip 5 is out, Imma get the Flip 4 for next to nothing"
Ugw0M_QUIvHdDELAsMV4AaABAg,Well I guess it&#39;s the reason why you need foldable phone by making its narrow outside screen.  Its slimmer and nice to hold. If you make it like normal brick phone. Maybe u will not use the inside screen. I mean the concept is not there.
UgzxwEAhuzKa1Ctt3X54AaABAg,‚ù§
UgwCw2hiwv_hiH1mBOp4AaABAg,I cant say enough good about my Fold 4 but I was hoping to get an upgraded Fold 5. Being that the changes are so minor ill definitely wait till the next gen.
UgzD7h7yf7g-eI-edl54AaABAg,Can you please do review of TECNO Phantom V phone
UgzbPelpV4Rn2wq9wAd4AaABAg,very informative and you makes me decide to get these fold5 aside from my old fold3.<br>Thanks
Ugz3LZM3emvH1iAJvjR4AaABAg,They&#39;ll never be as cool as the T-Mobile sidekicks.
UgzE7p3yUwQFT8O9BLZ4AaABAg,Still hate the idea of these phones. That stupid ass line and everything. I hope these dont last. They arent close to needed and samsung just wants it to catch so bad but it will never be as popular as there regular series. Hell I still wish we didnt have edges on a phone yet i got the ultra because it offered the 1440p and wanted the biggest screen and felt like it was the king and yes it is but the whole flip thing is retarded af. <br><br>Still chargij 1k for a phone that isnt closw to the hardware and capabilities as there s23 for less. Its close enoufh to the ultra price it makes no sense to choose that over the ultra for only 200 more.
UgzzrzDfnWsR9V0jtqR4AaABAg,"Mr Brownlee talking in a language I can&#39;t recognize, cool"
UgwyZWmgplLvBgUIgF94AaABAg,I remember 10 years ago my friends making fun of me for my &quot;Phablet&quot; - a Note 3. They didn&#39;t believe me when I said the Note 3 will be standard size of phones in the future.

UgwjiabO223NddjU7bN4AaABAg,I loved my note edge
UgzGand9mToq59b7BEB4AaABAg,"I agree the outer screen is stupidly sized. Absolute nightmare to use the keyboard properly with bigger hands. I thought it would be same size as the inner screen of the flip, and open to something closer to a 1:1 aspect"
UgzRdK5WHKGo2J4fuVV4AaABAg,im getting the flip 4 tomorrow. it will be my first samsung phone in 6-7 years. im super excited about it
UgwkY9XbovfgsEJ1l6h4AaABAg,Double tablet battery storage everything
UgwfVqfoGQqlDJgcvcZ4AaABAg,I want a tablet laptop literally a folding tablet that turns into a laptop use the screen like a touch pad and use swipe or Bluetooth physical keyboard
UgypESuyKCpT2BHZQ9d4AaABAg,iPhone made the same phone for 15 years at least Samsung is doing it with a phone that can foldüéâüéâüéâ
UgwSWREMbuGGWfhc_cN4AaABAg,Samsung foldable size is the best. Easy to hold while closed. Top tier phone
Ugw8ykCB0FI9cAmr7CF4AaABAg,I would say the zflip5 and the zfold5 is good I don&#39;t know both are good
UgzPj7-YdZFFjBct4ex4AaABAg,"Based off availability on Samsung&#39;s website, it looks like the Fold 5 isn&#39;t selling to well"
UgyCwuNMn73WLu1HriR4AaABAg,I don&#39;t need a folding phone. I need a folding 24 INCH FOLDING TABLET.

Ugyih45k6cpRtGJKwPt4AaABAg,If someone needed a new phone would u suggest they get the new foldable?
UgxkCuWIYR54AthLrcV4AaABAg,Your android user not a apple user your not tied to a logo you are freedom wake up in buy the pixel fold
UgzubDpY4shKkgYQMDt4AaABAg,No narrow screens no !narrow screens!!! Go on strike with me punish Samsung for the foolish behavior buy the Pixel fold we must show them what we want dont let that sausage screen control you üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ugx8yKuNnVUN0VXtzkh4AaABAg,"Got a &quot;free&quot; upgrade to a fold 5 from my s9 after 6 years, much more confident in the design than when it first came out<br><br>But i work a trade job and am interested to see if its lower durability can handle it, things like dust and dirt in in pockets, paint or crud on fingers, case drops etc"
UgysxBtYcZbOXVJbhPF4AaABAg,"Nice review of the Samsung Galaxy Fold 5 and Flip 5. I think the $1800 price for the fold is to much, it should be a $1300 phone. I don&#39;t need a Fold tablet because in my Haggar classic fit pants large pocket a carry a $600 Samsung F21 phone and a Samsung $100 8 inch tablet."
UgxEzXWknh5gLzg-un14AaABAg,WHY AM I GETTING THIS DUBBED??? Stop it! It&#39;s awful!

Ugxulo42ZJOJZFh1CYZ4AaABAg,The width of the zflips is just too small.
UgwFpekKTyvA1vYL-Sx4AaABAg,i don&#39;t know why samsung make these kind of modal most people don&#39;t like it
Ugy5HhwquEtMrNV9nB94AaABAg,Marques says there is no upgrade and then continues to talk about them in next 5 minutes
UgyS095-2I92i7bDnsV4AaABAg,"Remember when the Wachowskis were looking for someone to make the Matrix Phone (from Reloaded) and every phone company was like &quot;nope, that can&#39;t be done&quot; and Samsung was like &quot;hold my beeper&quot; and they DID IT. Like the battery that felt like reloading a gun, the slide out ear piece, adding clips from the film as part of the phone just because they could. Really felt like if anyone was going to innovate in the space it would be Samsung. Hoping they can break the mold going forward, I&#39;d hate to see them settle in at this point."
UgzXJ4Sv-z02Q2vZQrZ4AaABAg,#############(SYSTEM)has has joined the chat today is the celebrating for YouTubers and YouTube thank you for supporting our app and god bless may god put you in haven
UgwfwWi7k32YzI6_Z-14AaABAg,"They folding screen on the Fold finally folds flat. Well done, Samsung. I&#39;ll wait for the 6th iteration next year."
UgxaVV33PSgJ1LvxndN4AaABAg,"So on one end with the Flip 5, you get the gen 2 processor, which the majority of people realistically wont notice the difference from gen 1. The other end with the Razor+, you get a larger outside screen that is fully usable, not limited to widgets like the Flip 5 . Having a hard time seeing a reason to get the Flip 5 instead."
UgybeydR65Pna1V14jV4AaABAg,Fall in love Z Flold5‚ù§
Ugw6gpzTHoFxv9VAdv94AaABAg,I always felt like every 2 phones is when a major change happens to a platform

Is there any company available where I can make customized mobile like by choosing my preferred chipset,motherboard,camera sensor etc.and that company will build my device like we build customized Computer setup?Of course it should be under normal person budget.<br>Plz answer this ques.Thanks"
UgzYVZtENTgTq6UOCS94AaABAg,Damn...I kinda expected more

Ugw0HR3YS_C-82G_cIN4AaABAg,"Samsung phones are the best in the world. I don&#39;t see any Apple phones competing with Samsung. It&#39;s my humble opinion. Well done, Samsung.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
UgzqkR0nVhvDORltMVd4AaABAg,"Got the flip 4 last year and decided I wouldn&#39;t be upgrading this year unless the cameras got an improvement, and they didn&#39;t. I actually prefer the smaller back screen too. Plus considering the trade in value of the flip 3 this year if seems like waiting till next year will be a better value for the improvmemts (at least I hope it will"
Ugzt-RBVVsyyszAYjLN4AaABAg,"As a person whos never owned a fold, all the &quot;imma stick with my fold4 / fold3&quot; comments is making me excited cause i know once i get my fold 5 i wont need to replace it for a while"
Ugx7h0uQIP21MbKqwuR4AaABAg,$1800 hundred...ü§î<br>Prices for phones are Ridiculous....<br>And the embedded apps they put in. Is a no no...
UgzgScAy_uYcS9WnSl14AaABAg,"I have no idea why they don&#39;t just put the same cameras in the Fold as they have in the Ultra. Are they afraid that will make the Ultra redundant? It&#39;s just frustrating as a customer to want the functionality without sacrificing content creation capabilities, and it&#39;s pushing me away from Samsung altogether. I&#39;d rather they just give us the best of what they have now, stop with these annual mini-updates and release a significantly improved phone in 2-3 years."
Ugz2ZwAqX8v1HdM_QkJ4AaABAg,im not hating just saying he said its the &quot;samsung way&quot; to not make many improvements when apple is sitting right there playing inocent like the only noticible difference is the damn camera
Ugyae8KKceRniJNZnd14AaABAg,I need this phone; I will be upgrading soon.
Ugz7pVP3NVQyrAulSSF4AaABAg,"It is ok there is not much new. It has been just one year, we cannot expect much. And we should actually be glad, less temptation to buy a new phone every two years or so :)"
UgyWK1HUHaluWKX6KJ14AaABAg,"Apple- &quot;In the new iPhone, we have a new camera, a new chip, a different notch, different components.<br>Public- &quot;booooooooo&quot;<br>Samsung- &quot;New hinge, bigger outside screen&quot;<br>Public- &quot;It&#39;s okay, what else can you update on a folding phone.&quot;"
UgzhqxJfMUR_qPuh_k54AaABAg,Next they gonna bring back the extendable antenna. Lol
UgxaoUA5nZFbTsQ1afJ4AaABAg,You should do more standalone reviews of the products instead of just what‚Äôs changed because I don‚Äôt know anything about the last model and just want to ditch my iPhone
UgxghW7c2clRtOv5obV4AaABAg,I‚Äôll wait for the fold 5 to improve two more years then I‚Äôll probably get it
UgzpFBqWhQTzNw7JsNx4AaABAg,I love my Flip 4. I only flip it when necessary. Easy on the hands too
Ugw5BWHcqPYmC6r4eh14AaABAg,I like a narrow phone.  My S23U is just too big.
Ugx7RGL_a3RUpT64irx4AaABAg,"Truth be told, these foldable devices have started to look like outdated technologies. It has somehow not evolved well. They are big/ bulky, not very easily stored in person and no additional features which differentiates itself from today‚Äôs generation of smartphones"
UgzazuL0fLuJ6m-NfeR4AaABAg,Still use and are happy with my fold 3. I don&#39;t really see a reason to upgrade yet so hopefully it will last another year or two.
UgxYHobIs-tlQrX7XIB4AaABAg,Is it worth getting the fold 5 or just get the fold 4 same stuff but cheaper
Ugx1WBwBKfbgYIS1DtZ4AaABAg,"I would love to see Samsung making cheaper folding phones next year. I would love a phone in the form factor of the Z flip, it would help me so much on reducing my screentime without compromising on the handy phone stuff. Its just that I&#39;m not in the market where I can afford to spend a 1000 euro&#39;s on a phone. Especially when Im not sold that big on camera&#39;s and most of that price is for premium camera&#39;s."
UgwVbnlMmyCLvqWlAFN4AaABAg,For my personal needs the fold is great but at that price I‚Äôd rather just stick
UgyzDEJsIuEtebqTmHh4AaABAg,Please do a video on the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic
Ugx3BKdIpa7r07HQ3oF4AaABAg,"So, foldable phones are just concept cars for smart phones?<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>Does anyone really want these? <br><br> I&#39;m not talking about techie people, I&#39;m talking about the masses"
UgwwGq_qUAf5HwR0vrt4AaABAg,"So, I should buy the s23 ultra?<br><br>or the plus if I don&#39;t need fancy cameras and 8k, which I don&#39;t."
UgxUxCRezc_NwfFnmH54AaABAg,Come from @ATC ‚ù§
UgxS47TyMd9Arw-tS494AaABAg,an overview of tough smartphone cases for trekking/construction/farming/biking etc use would be much appreciated<br>also more on robustness and durability in general between the different brands I think would be very popular<br>eg folding phone durability is a bummer I believe...<br>many broken smartphones out there ....
UgzJ5WJJrS8P1Xx9P3p4AaABAg,"Besides just wanting it,  I&#39;m trying to justify buying this."
Ugz5RKlgx93DR5J1eO14AaABAg,"only good use of a fold phone is being able to use the rear camera for selfies, Otherwise this is just another bad idea like curved displayhs"
UgzufvR2IUyIHsDLYhl4AaABAg,"I want to buy one just to support the progression of the technology, but the price tag is out to lunch.<br><br>I think I said the same thing for the Fold 1."
UgxMaKq0NEwlsnD3C1d4AaABAg,"Samsung is probably intentionally sticking to the narrow and tall form factor because that really makes you to use phone unfolded. It is a bit ironic but bad external screen experience will force you to use internal screen more often, which ultimately would give you even better experience than wider external screen.<br><br>As a long time Z fold user, I think getting used to unfold the screen more often is kinda difficult to get used to, but you can get the most out of it once you do. If you stick to use cover screen more often, then basically you have thicker, heavier normal phone with worse battery time."
UgwhBdQ6fazNBSKhIEZ4AaABAg,That new spen is horrible look. Like a super long note pen. What they change it from last year. and why the hell did they get rid of grey green. Now I have to choose from girly blue or cream or standard black. Which basically gives me one boring option. This is the same as apple coming out with Barney purple. Stupid decision. Why not grey blue
UgwRFUUoXPsCZsza5IN4AaABAg,I love the tall slim design personally.  It&#39;s almost reminiscent of our old Nokia phones in terms of feel in hand. I only open my fold for YouTube and movies. Really wish I had a stylus that I could use on inner AND outer display. I rocked with the Note line from the 4 to the 20.
UgyQoWa_PirOB-yZKZJ4AaABAg,Can i open 2 chrome tabs simultaneously on Z fold 5?
Ugzf0WHwlm40hYigUF14AaABAg,weird portuguese audio
UgyjKOuEKOKT7phl48l4AaABAg,I may get rid of my iPhone for this galaxy fold
UgyY5Tg46coynM0LX1t4AaABAg,I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s the same. I&#39;m bought the Fold 5 for $353. iPhone users have been buying the same for 10 year. It&#39;s my time to be a drone lol.
UgwkSDZtrAAxc1DEy2x4AaABAg,"Currently, I&#39;d only consider the flip 4 or 5 as it&#39;s about the size of a standard size s. If they make it more like a standard but can clamshell or go to mini tablet using the standard size or the ultra size, I&#39;m open. And put that pen in like the ultra too. I think for people to be open, it needs to be a step up from flagship, not it being weird but bigger"

Just FYI, we do care about our phones and have best cases. <br>I will wait and see if Razr will have same problems with hinges (They used to make nice phones and my wife liked old razr and krazr.<br>Ps, Nice review.

Being an S23 ultra user, feeling depressed and disappointed for choosing Samsung.."
UgzWl9trlzQYUrSm2Zt4AaABAg,Which is better? Samsung S23 Ultra or Samsunf=g Fold 5?
Ugy3kcTGjheiWtpzplt4AaABAg,"Bro I just copied the entire script of the video:<br> So this is the brand-new Z Fold 5 and the Z Flip 5. This is what it looks like when Samsung settles. I&#39;ll explain. (upbeat music) So welcome to your first look at Samsung&#39;s newest generation of foldables. They look very similar to last year. Matter of fact, you probably didn&#39;t even realize that this is last year&#39;s phone. So Samsung makes two foldables right now. There&#39;s the Z Flip 5 and the Z Fold 5. Same exact shape and dimensions as last year, same aspect ratios, same cameras, same batteries. It would actually be faster for me to just tell you everything that&#39;s different, so that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m gonna do. So I&#39;ll start with the Flip 5, the more interesting one. It gets an upgrade to the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip that&#39;s been both powerful and efficient in the S23 series, and it gets a new and improved hinge that&#39;s smaller in every dimension and actually has less moving parts. It&#39;s simpler, which should help with everyday durability, and it now allows the phone to fold completely flat. I don&#39;t really see or feel any difference with the crease on the other side. It&#39;s, you know, still the same tech that we&#39;ve been using on the screen for a few years now. It&#39;s just the fact that Samsung has gotten rid of the gaps, so it folds down a little bit smaller, a little thinner, and is less likely to catch any dust or debris on the inside because it&#39;s flat. But the main upgrade is definitely the larger outside screen. So this is something that&#39;s slowly, steadily been getting bigger and bigger with each generation. The Z Flip 4, you might remember, had the biggest yet. That was a 1.9-inch cover display. This one is graduating up to a 3.4-inch Flex window that goes almost from corner to corner &#39;cause, you know, you gotta name everything. It&#39;s very clearly not quite as bold as what Motorola did with the Razr Plus, which is this crazy, it&#39;s actually corner to corner basically, and there&#39;s, like, cutouts for the cameras, which, it&#39;s pretty sick. It&#39;s very visually striking. But the idea is the same, which is that it&#39;s giving you more readable, glanceable information and making it more usable before you even open it. So as the size of the outside display has expanded, so has the size of the dozen-plus widgets that work on the outside screen, showing you everything from clocks and timers to notifications and messages. There&#39;s also a new pinch gesture to zoom out, and it&#39;ll show you all of the widget screens you have enabled, which is kind of smart. Kind of feels smart watch-ish. But anyway, the new screen is also covered in Gorilla Glass Victus 2, as well as the back of the phone. And that&#39;s it. That&#39;s all that&#39;s new. New cover screen, new chip, new hinge. Everything else, everything else from the cameras to the battery to the charging speed to the crease, the speakers, the inside screen is all the same as last year, except the base storage because the $1,000 starting price now will get you 256 gigs of storage instead of 128. That&#39;s good to see. So then the Z Fold 5, the big dog, actually has even less new here. So it also gets the new chip, it&#39;s also got Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and it also has a new hinge. And I don&#39;t think that should be underrated. Like, that&#39;s clearly one of the most important parts of a folding phone, so the fact that it now is slightly thinner and slightly more durable and folds completely flat, all of that is thanks to the hinge and that&#39;s all sweet. But then also, the inside display is now actually much brighter. It gets up to 1,750 nits, which is dramatically better than last year, which was 1,000 nits, so that&#39;s awesome. And then, yeah, that&#39;s it. Like, the outside screen is the same tall 6.2-inch cover display. The triple camera system on the back appears to be exactly the same hardware. The under-display 4-megapixel selfie camera hidden in the big display is also exactly the same. The battery size is the same, the charging speeds are the same, it&#39;s IPX8 water resistant again. There is a new S Pen. I&#39;ll say this. The S Pen for Fold is now 40% thinner than the last one. It still doesn&#39;t go inside the phone like a S23 Ultra or a Galaxy Note used to, but at least if you wanna carry it alongside the phone in that little case they made for it, it&#39;ll stick out way less because it&#39;s this flat shape. And there are some software improvements, like a few more optimized apps, you know, like Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, when the screen is open or halfway open. And the improved task bar at the bottom can now show up to four of your most recent apps, which, I guess that goes pretty hard for multitasking. But, you know, I believe these things can also make it to the last gen Fold. All that being said, that phone&#39;s also gonna start at the same price as last year, $1,799. I saw all this stuff, and Samsung told me about the phones, and I was thinking about it for a little bit, and I guess I kind of came to the conclusion that this is just the Samsung way. It&#39;s not like they&#39;re getting lazy or something, like it&#39;s a small, minor update, and that&#39;s all Samsung ever does anymore. But it&#39;s more just, this is on this state of foldables in general and where Samsung sits in that space. So I made a video like a year ago on the state of foldables &#39;cause we had a bunch of them coming out, and I&#39;ll leave a link below if you wanna watch it, but basically the conclusion I came to is there are three form factors that we&#39;ve been settling on, which is the Flips, the Folds, and the others. And so my theory on the way Samsung operates in this space is, basically, they&#39;re so settled into these two form factors and being safe with these and churning along with them that any drastic change, any major change that I would want would actually probably just be a new phone. Like, okay, think about this. In the past, we&#39;ve typically seen Samsung just throw stuff at the wall just to see what sticks. They&#39;re not afraid to have 1,000 different phones in their lineup. They practically invented big phones. Do you remember the Samsung Galaxy Mega? This is gonna sound crazy, but one day, Samsung decided to just make a gigantic phone. Compared to what else was out, it looked like this next to normal phones at the time. But sure enough, over the years, guess what? We kind of settled into that form factor, and that 6.3-inch Galaxy Mega today would be a pretty normal-sized flagship phone. You remember the Galaxy Note Edge? Eight years ago, Samsung tried curving the display over the edge of the side of the phone when no one else had really done that before, and now they&#39;ve been settling into that sort of thing ever since. Same deal with the Note and styluses. So as I hold the new Z Fold 5, yeah, it&#39;s super similar to last year&#39;s phone, which was a really good phone, but the thing is now that I&#39;ve held some of these others, like the OPPO and especially the Pixel Fold, I am struck by how tall and narrow Samsung&#39;s outside cover screen is. It doesn&#39;t feel nearly as natural as the Pixel Fold. And I don&#39;t really enjoy typing on it or watching content on a display that&#39;s so tall and awkwardly shaped either. But for whatever reason, it feels like Samsung is so set on settling in and just iterating on these two form factors that they&#39;ve already made. So if they were to decide, &quot;Oh, yeah, we should make, like, a more passport-shaped foldable,&quot; I think they&#39;d just make a whole nother phone. So there&#39;s a bunch of other smaller things I was really hoping to see in this update, like an improvement on the under-display selfie camera that I&#39;ve been talking about on the inside screen. But this appears to be literally the exact same hardware, so you&#39;re still gonna have some heavy processing and some rough image quality there. It would&#39;ve been nice to see the improved back cameras get closer to the flagship status of the S23 series, but they&#39;re also using the same sensors back there again as well, which were fine. A bigger capacity battery would&#39;ve been cool to see to match the Pixel Fold or even a slot where the new super slim S Pen maybe could&#39;ve been stored inside the phone. That would&#39;ve been legitimately very impressive innovation. But still, even leaving so many of these things literally the same as last year, collectively, it&#39;s still gonna be a pretty safe phone. As far as folding phones that you can buy right now, this one&#39;s still gonna be really good. There&#39;s also some other hardware, by the way, at this announcement. Samsung did this whole Unpacked event. There&#39;s some incremental improvements on the watches with bigger screens and thinner rotating bezels that are super sweet. And the new S9 series of tablets, they just got the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip as well. And I still just love the S9 Ultra so much. What a ridiculous, awesome, gigantic tablet with a 14-1/2-inch, 120-hertz display, just a razor-thin monster media device. I&#39;m just glad this exists, so just wanted to shout that out. But that&#39;s all we&#39;ve got for now. I&#39;m super curious to hear what you guys actually think of Samsung keeping especially the $1,800 folding phone price and not really changing much, but let me know. Till the next one. Catch you guys later. Peace."
Ugy_6XtlJQTecFGr4jB4AaABAg,I think i will wait for an openbox 1tb on best buy. For them to re-release the same phone with such little improvements at the same price point is just a middle finger to the consumer base. Why they couldn&#39;t shove a 8000mAh battery in such a large form factor is just arrogance
Ugxfa-eDqPcNWVHVIG54AaABAg,I just want samsung to make the zfold wider. Like i hate the super narrow screen design when its closed

Ugwo31bbluxM_i74Hel4AaABAg,Hey I hope people see this and yourself sees this... I purchased the fold 4 loved it until it broke down the crease I have now been in a battle with Samsung for over 2 weeks. They won&#39;t repair it and sent me a bill of ¬£538! Which is a lot to pay for something you didn&#39;t break the reason is that there&#39;s a small scratch on the side of the front screen. I have been told by people high up in Samsung that they agree with me that it&#39;s not my fault but due to terms and conditions I have to pay! Please don&#39;t by into these prototype folds I don&#39;t want anyone to go through this.

Ugy13MHZeeyOMJK8FUx4AaABAg,"I know it&#39;s an unpopular opinion but imo Samsung should keep this form factor for the sake of variety/choice.<br>There are already enough (and increasingly more) Foldables that have a &quot;normal&quot; form factor. If I was interested in a new phone right now and wanted such a Foldable, I&#39;d just wait for the Western release of the Magic V2.<br><br>But it&#39;s nice to have the option to buy a Foldable with Z Fold&#39;s form factor, too. It has a couple of unique advantages.<br>1. It&#39;s much more comfortable to operate one-handed, even if you don&#39;t have big hands<br>2. Due to it being narrower, you can get a case with a SPen holder on the side without the phone becoming <i>too</i> wide. <br><br>People who have fat fingers or are awful at typing and thus think &quot;it&#39;s too narrow!!&quot; have other options. It&#39;s nice to have this option, too.<br><br>edit: an alternative would be to add some width but have an integrated SPen like the Ultra."

Ugz3VY7qmOBZ1KAqJ-R4AaABAg,A phone is only good as the software it has and the apps it supports. Flips and foldables are expensive gizmos bought by dumb rich people with half baked software and limited customized apps.  Apple is probably waiting until all the Samsung clients (guinea pigs) point out all the problems and flaws with the concept to finally launch the definitive flip phone. We all know that....

UgwUW1AQnpjjqbb461V4AaABAg,Samsung slowly becoming apple (nothing new just more expensive)
UgxXDVGd952BkJvtla54AaABAg,I wouldn&#39;t touch a flip phone ever. My mate has a flip 4 and the crease looks like someone has keyed a scratch along it and it&#39;s not even a year old yet
UgxzedEqupLPW69OYyl4AaABAg,Can&#39;t stand these foldable phones
UgxGCVoEOABheVyyi6d4AaABAg,That&#39;s Called A Honest Review
UgwqDA2Et0znp0eNyaR4AaABAg,Never settle üò≠
UgwqCQhrquOD809mhE94AaABAg,30FPS shirt üëï looks good
UgzW946sJKQkpHAR_VV4AaABAg,Haha<br>Clearly biased video!<br><br>Apple has same iphone design for about 7 years now. Never did MKBHD make a video titled ‚Äú Apple settled ‚Äú .<br>But samsung keeps looks same for one year and oh its a disaster. <br><br>Haha<br><br>Wonder how much Apple pays you bro to bash Samsung like this. <br><br>I have an iPhone and a samsung too. So I ain‚Äôt a fan of either one. But its disgusting to hear these words from you for Samsung when we all know all Apple did a year ago was change back camera hinge location on the iPhone.<br><br><br>Totally disappointed brother.<br><br>I expect un biased reviews from you.
UgwBfuWF0sVWOm276KB4AaABAg,"So I waited after the release of the Razr Plus to see what Samsung had on deck with the Z Flip 5. My decision is a easy one and it boils down to one factor . What are the capabilities of the outside screen. The Razr wins hands down . Almost every App is able to be used on the screen, Samsung well you get a stopwatch , some weather but besides some widgets you can&#39;t use any Apps . So what&#39;s the point. Specs are both even but the screen .. Motorola wins hands down . Maybe the Z flip 6 will work the way it was intended üòÇ"
UgxmOtAE4ZTmvyh52Uh4AaABAg,Still waiting for that screen tech breakthrough I guess :(
UgxCuo74Z37s5GrFI7d4AaABAg,how does one get samsung to understand that we need a better camera for the flip... because the foldability aspect of this phone elevates the smartphone photography experience to a whole new game
UgyAHFH3yvFhegBtoqp4AaABAg,Better off the tablet was foldable<br>That would be great üëçüèª
Ugwi_--l-0snCsa88ut4AaABAg,"I&#39;m debating on upgrading from my Z Flip 4. Love it but the larger outside screen would be nice. Which would you recommend between the Flip 5 and the Razr+? Also, do you know if this current gen Razr has the same bluetooth delay issue as the 2020 version?"
UgyToCPktARmpn2AVP94AaABAg,"The most important thing for me was the nearly doubling of the inner screen display brightness, the hinge, and the durability if the battery lasts longer because of a more efficient chipset I will upgrade. People talk about battery size , but apple has consistently had half the capacity of most androids and still some of the best battery life. We need a more efficient android OS and optimization. On a side note, I know people complain about the narrow front screen or the bad cameras, but who&#39;s really buying this phone to use the front screen? I have gigantic hands, and it didn&#39;t take me much time to get used to it, and now the narrowness doesn&#39;t even bother me. As far as the cameras go I agree that that should be fixed especially for the price you pay however samsung must have done some market research that indicated that most fold users probably don&#39;t use their cameras that much. I would love better quality photos but if I&#39;m honest I barely use this phone to take photos I use it to consume media and that&#39;s why they focused on durability of the hinge and the brightness because they are banking on it being enough of an upgrade for most average users."
UgwDsjdhbiO7NKpJNy54AaABAg,"I don‚Äôt get why people are obsessed with radical changes in design every year just to go ahead and criticise companies if they do indeed decide to go all out‚Ä¶ great products are refined and not revolutionised every year‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs crazy how we expect completely different and better designs of the same utility products every year, stupid‚Ä¶"

Ugx1INHGQRlKR4djAP94AaABAg,"As someone who jumped in on the Flip 4 last year, I immediately jumped on an pre-ordered the Flip 5. Especially with all of the discounts Samsung had going (not sure if they&#39;re still going on), I pretty much paid taxes to upgrade and added their buds for another $45 i think it was. No hesitation."
UgyB1OkfSByTG1omno14AaABAg,"Basically, samsung likes to break boundaries. Everyone made fun of samsung for making foldable phones, but it&#39;s not bad. it&#39;s actually good. But I think their intentions are money with these new z flips with so many holes, they will have the opportunity to make a new phone."
Ugw4aUSXrFYsLEUyeOZ4AaABAg,"So I have a Fold4, and I love it. However, the inside screen got a bubble in the middle, and it just grew and grew. I&#39;m getting it replaced because it&#39;s under warranty, but do I really want to? Maybe upgrade to the Fold5, but is it worth it? Or go back to the S (my last phone was a S21) and get the S23. If I don&#39;t get a new full year warranty on the replacement of my Fold4, I&#39;m not going to keep it. Any suggestions would be great."

UgzEhawhurae8DrRp194AaABAg,what happens when you get some grit on the screen and then you fold it shut in your pocket for a few hours... stuff that. Just another fad...again
UgwILgWl2xntdReyeGh4AaABAg,"I had the zfold 3. The screen crease turned black. I was unable to use one side of the screen. So until they get rid of the crease no fold&#39;s for me. Loved the phone though  minus the camera, the outside screen and the pen not being embeded into the phone."

UgwwMWn4siBMUNCay254AaABAg,Which is better motor razr + or samsung flip5?
Ugwq4F9Xr4MMSBWFJpx4AaABAg,The galaxy mega!!! Omg I still remember and always wished I had that phone when it first came out. I would still buy a brand new one to this day but anyways ZF5 trash. Should‚Äôve been 1.1k and Z flip 899$. Ridiculous and yes they‚Äôre getting lazy. No 4k screen no real innovation then wtf they doing with R&amp;D then???!

UgxlvVTQN_zSveA_YgR4AaABAg,With the little upgrades this year id still like the fold 5 it looks so refined and fresh looking compared to previous generations but the flip 5 caught me a lot i love the new cover display a lot more than the motorola razr ultra if the flip 5 gets significant upgrades surely samsung couldve upgraded their z fold but i think next year would be the year for the z fold mega upgrade

I still have it in my drawer and it still works. Only things I changed were the batteries (back then they were removable). If the pricing was right, I would definitely get myself the Samsung Flip. I already own a Tab S and Note 10."
UgzZEQP22jNYKlopN5R4AaABAg,I agree with the passport size phone like the Blackberry Passport. I had that before and love the size of it. I hope they make a foldable passport size with an actual keyboard.
Ugy8_09_DTcxf8IguYN4AaABAg,"I feel like it kind of a shame they didn&#39;t adres the one and only thing I don&#39;t like about the Fold 4, which is the battery life. It gets through the day but barely, and sometimes I find myself recharging it before or around dinner time.<br><br>Hinge doesn&#39;t feel like an upgrade, makes scratching the inside screen more easily."
Ugw_ld7al7SQsp0sYUV4AaABAg,"Next year, full screen on both sides."

UgxSCsk81NqC5oShQq94AaABAg,I am going to pick up a Z Fold. Simply because they will give me $1000 credit on my Ultra 22. When I looked at trading in last year for a Ultra 23 they where only going to give me like half that much. So I guess they really want me to upgrade this time?

UgwkZyxKCgv0vABp9T14AaABAg,"Samsung was incredibly lazy with the fold5 just cause they felt like they had to release a fold phone every year. There&#39;s really no point in getting the Fold 5, might as well wait for the Fold 6"

Ugw7tWk3OMonghMbSR94AaABAg,"If you want crazy high end features then get the 23/24 ultra ,the galaxy fold was meant to be a good foldable phone bruh with decent cameras and everything else,now once we get crazy cameras on the galaxy fold then how much do you expect Samsung to price it for? 3000USD? The same people would cry again.‚Äùfolding phone‚Äù that‚Äôs the main focus,hence why the cameras are good and not super insane ."
UgwCE1ZmIhN6gFVM9Lt4AaABAg,"If only there were a way to make the flip dust proof. I do concrete grinding, which of course creates a lot of dust. With that said, I can&#39;t even bring a fold/flip phone to the job site. Gotta stick to the 23 Ultra."

UgxPKH7kwW_XakvCmGd4AaABAg,hello from athens greece. we know that all of you youtubers are paid by companies to advertise their products. and that&#39;s why you only say the positives and not the negatives. because I have two things to say about the compared packages. at least for Europe you pay 1200 euros for the z flip 5 and 1850 euros for the fold 5 and you have neither autonomy in the battery nor fast charging. I think it&#39;s funny but also a joke
UgyUWHcP_oEgLST3wDN4AaABAg,This guy never talks like this when it comes to Apple products. Iphone basically is the same one every single year. üíØ Biased.
UgxzbcdJFv3A7TweXIF4AaABAg,Was playing around with these in the mall yesterday. They have a new case for the pen that is flat and has a sliding lock to pop it in and out.<br>Was pretty cool and wasn&#39;t too hefty feeling.

UgxvsUFvelgy_PDJsRV4AaABAg,"I think foldables and flips are just complicating things. I have to do an extra action, which is to unfold the phone, whereas with normal phones I don&#39;t. They still occupy the same space in my pocket."

Ugz5lSY9QzHvYeeAh3J4AaABAg,Samsung the apple of android with not really changing phones at all anymore and playing it safe. We really really do not need new phones every year. Every 2 3 years seems much more logical. Improvements are just not enough anymore to warrant every year new phones.

UgwvCk7Ll-U05S_a2gl4AaABAg,Motorola definitely conquered the front screen way more visually pleasing front screen even incorporating the cameras somehow makes them not so noticeable to me but the new Samsung front screen with the cameras makes it looks bulky chunky non cohesive.

UgxzkELAMWZ7fBUYu794AaABAg,"I am so close to biting the bullet and upgrading my Note 20 Ultra (which is a fantastic phone that feels just as up to date as the day I purchased it) to a Fold. The only thing Samsung has to do is provide a comparable camera setup. The camera system is a deal breaker for me especially when they are asking me to drop that amount of money. Until they can do that, I&#39;ll stick with what I have."
UgyN9xUOOOfaSAusAmV4AaABAg,"Samsung today is the Toyota of the phone industry. They are still innovative and ahead of the curve for the tech minded audience but they are also a safe company for a general consumer to buy from. They provide a solid and reliable product while still being innovative and futuristic, which is miles better than what Apple is offering these day imo."

UgySDUPUGYvhBeEp2eJ4AaABAg,I loved my Samsung Mega.
UgxyFpq5Js3pm462aWF4AaABAg,"I would&#39;ve happily upgraded from the Fold 4 to the 5 if they somehow got rid of the camera bump. I may be in the minority here since this doesn&#39;t seem to bother most people. A lot complain about the crease or the front screen or the gap (which they fixed with this new design) but I&#39;m honestly fine with all of that. Being able to fold completely flat is nice and all but I just wish the phone would sit flat on a table without having to put it screen side down. This is really the only thing I don&#39;t like about modern phone design. The horizontal camera bump is fine for normal shaped phones since there&#39;s no rocking but the vertical design always bothered me. I just wish they&#39;d put the camera in the phone, behind the back glass. Maybe I&#39;m crazy but after a year with the Fold 4 coming from a Note 9, this is my only real complaint."
UgyEGtYH0hmkUgMUi8t4AaABAg,"I have two lines work/home and I gave the iPhone 14 pro an earnest try for three months, but just couldn&#39;t bond. So I ended up trading it for an s23 ultra (love). For my other line, other carrier, üòÖwent with the flip 4 (typing on it now), and really enjoy it, but the $900 + $50 trade deal for the flip 5 made it too easy for me to pass up"
UgxYfTT3xHx2oHz9FFB4AaABAg,What is wrong with refining the existing design or form factor until it is perfected  before moving on to a totally brand new phone design or idea? That&#39;s better than coming up with different junk ones every  year just for the sake of having something different!

UgwBuXjtpoqak0NUHH94AaABAg,So for the folding phones Samsung did like Apple with the iPhone 13 and 14 except Samsung did boost the processor a little bit... The innovation on all phones in general did not really evolve very much since the last 3 years.

UgwXoTk-MhLH_a_HjJ94AaABAg,Both of these phones changed the game. Many ppl are not aware of technological dependencies forgetting that there&#39;s always something for something. You can&#39;t eat the cake and have a cake.  The good design aims for the sweet spot. We all would like to have a battery that lasts for a week and can be charged in 5min - and weighs 5 grams and is super tiny. That&#39;s not gonna happen any soon. I like the fact the phone finally takes less space. And what makes me laugh is the fact that Apple didn&#39;t invent anything and their phones are nothing but bricks with no customization whatsoever.

UgyD7iytrwYkyaWNvQ14AaABAg,Samsung missed out by not aiming for making the Dex experience more robust on a Foldable
UgzMQr7Rj0Ztub6P-R14AaABAg,I still  remember how WSJ  marking this device when Z fold 1 came out.
Ugyhr6SRH3auydid_NV4AaABAg,That Z fold 5 just might be the one that makes me jump ship from Apple.
UgyR0BKneWd2gRNlweV4AaABAg,Expensive and they removed the sd card bummer
UgzC3WjKeWE0tgJOyW54AaABAg,Galaxy Fold 5 is a class apart phone.<br>Some of my friends have an iphone and believe me they didn&#39;t know that such kind of technology exist in the market.<br>Let me tell you a real one.. <br>I went to my friend room. He bought a macbook air m1 chip model.<br>He told me that now i dont have to write password instead apple has given fingerprint readers..!! What an innovation by apple that it has installed fingerprint readers in laptops..!!<br><br>I said to him whats new in this even my laptop has it(lenovo thinkpad e14) and<br>Even my dell XPS(2008) Model had got a fingerprint scanner.<br><br>But he didn&#39;t believed..!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ugz0V0adI9P7SQ9VjHl4AaABAg,Honestly not sure what the urge is from the tech community to see android phone companies change something every year while apple releases near identical phones year in year out and the tech community just accepts it without asking any questions
UgwCxyMiVmVvsdBnlZV4AaABAg,Apples phones always look the same.
UgwPzkMbNkBR0vwkAtR4AaABAg,"Was hoping that the crease was gone, the plastic on the screen was stronger and that the cameras was the same as on the ultra. Also slightly bigger front screen. Sigh gonna have to wait for the 6th or even 7th generation then..."

UgwByMWITesRxTWgPvl4AaABAg,Still not in to foldable phones yet if they can get really good screen that can fold then i be on bord and phones iam rocking is samsung galaxy s23 ultra
UgzPNSKzaoQ-84_bmO94AaABAg,"I&#39;m currently on my fold 2 and I can&#39;t decide if it&#39;s better to upgrade to a fold 5, or the S23 ultra. Feels like I&#39;d miss the big screen if i go for the ultra, but damn the ultra is slick af. The fold&#39;s inner screen is awesome if you&#39;re surfing the net but the aspect ration of apps like IG/FB kinda kill it. At this rate i think i&#39;d probably just wait and see apple&#39;s Iphone 15 or just wait till next year&#39;s S24 ultra"

UgyUb6xjhFpewnU9mbp4AaABAg,We need two things : Wide outside display and integrated spen (inside of the phone).
Ugxrv1-Iu1c__5sF52V4AaABAg,"Honestly and i am always honest no matter what this is my way of view my opinion which msot people probbably  would agree.<br>Like with every fold or flip regardless of brand as long as the main screen is scratchable by nail (mohs scale 2) and the main screen does not contain GG Victus or better. Any kind even lowest of the low damage will damage your main screen which cant be covered by real 5D 9G screen protector like panzer glass or better and your phone is dead or with a big creses over your screen. And you have to pay expensive 700+ eur repair regardless of the device and brand.<br><br>Just like wth so called IPXX rating where no phone or manufacturer would give you water and dust damage warranty included in normal warranty fo your device you either must have a costly insurance for your device or you buy something like water and dust proof case from site like Alliexpress, Wish, Amazon, Ebay etc.<br>Few rubbers and seals dont help either because once exposed to sea water, chlorinated water any other liquid, dust, sand or sandstorm your phone is good as dead. <br><br>When companies will start making phones equal submarines I.E. will be completely WATER and DUST PROOF it will make significant duifference.<br>Right now as it is its just a costly gimmick where said water and dust proof case for as low as 2 euros protects better agains sea water than few rubbers and seals.<br><br>If said more or less expensive Chinese or Nonchinese companies would like to impress me and anyone else they shoudl offer real devices not useless gimicks. <br>Even a low cost 100 eur slab phone can withstand few rain drops without any hussle. <br>And for so called peace in mind few rubbers and seal does not helps because no company is willing to include water and dust resistance into warranty and when your phone is exposed to wter or dust damage yu ave to pay the very expensive repair. In case of water damage it could be as high as 3 times of your device costs.<br><br>Flip and folds are nothing just an overhyped device. And when said hype around them will be over at the end of the day user buy back is bar, slab phone he always liked. <br><br>Paying 1000-2500 euros for an useless gimmick is just tossing money out of a window for an obvious E-Waste where i honestly predict this o maybe next 3-5 more years and they are done for. New devices arent that better from previous generations and cost way more for same rubbish durability with no warranty or special care included. <br>No thanks.<br>Its simple as that. <br>End of story."
UgyLZBPDQ5GL8Rq8dS54AaABAg,They should&#39;ve used the s pen as a lock mechanism for the fold. It would encourage people to use them when in &quot;tablet&quot; mode.
UgxWBuGeQvL-AZO64JF4AaABAg,Both are hopeless for me if they don&#39;t have autofocus cameras.
Ugw_Xz8MqqUPnIUOK6h4AaABAg,"Is just a marketing strategy from Samsung to call attention from new buyers using same components of the year before, people with the Z4 won&#39;t upgrade in a year with small changes like that, average people are changing their phone every 2 years specially with this phones close to the 2k.<br>In my opinion they should make the front screen wider, and get rid of the crease, rearrange the 3  cameras to two rows that will make a huge different and more people will be interested.<br>There are many phones out there with better screens without the crease when there are open."
UgwekZ-Sww-VL3FiiHB4AaABAg,"My issue with z fold series, they are too small. Much bigger screen and bigger battery would fit into the standard pocket."

UgwgdcqXI_gYMhoNAsl4AaABAg,The reason why the Samsung flip series never became a big thing is because of the price. One can buy a full fledged laptop in the price of Samsung fold 5.

UgwcSyS975Ec2H8tokB4AaABAg,"Disappointed with the Fold 5, especially the hardware. The hinge still seems a full generation behind the Chinese foldables, even the Pixel Fold hinge is thinner. But the Fold 5 still has the best software for foldable"

Ugz7zPUjJrfiKhVuGSl4AaABAg,"Samsung is doing the same thing with folding mobile as apple did with iphone 12 &amp; 13. I have a thought/question, how does Samsung do these things when they make fun of their competitor for doing same  thing like &quot;Charger does not come in box by default&quot;."
UgwJ3xFZX6RwfLPk-wJ4AaABAg,"I know it isn&#39;t the most popular opinion but I have really grown to love the Taller more narrow cover screen of the Z Fold series, I have briefly used the Pixel Fold and it&#39;s design feels weird to me, the shorter more passport like design just feels awkward to me and the inner display aspect ratio suffers from it as well in my opinion. I&#39;ve been using the Fold 3 for nearly 2 years and I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll upgrade to the Fold 5 yet or not."
UgzoK2_PQkEJwUEFNy54AaABAg,"The thing about Samsung is that they set the bar pretty high every year with new innovations and designs while Apple basically uses the same thing for about 3 4 years in a row. When you give people more , they want more. That&#39;s why, we see people not calling Apple out and its always Samsung Do more!"

UgxPx1I8rHlPgTumuZZ4AaABAg,"Here are ergonomy flaws of Fold4 that made me switch to conventional form factor S23 ultra after 6 months of use. <br><br>1. Having no place to grip on the sides which makes it pretty hard to unfold. It is slippery some times and really you need to dig with your nails to grip and unfold.<br>2. Having single key for locking and unlocking also as a fingerprint reader. It takes three times to click to unlock. Sometimes it unlocks and locks again. Hard to feel when it is unlocked, especially when the fingerprint reader is slow sometimes. <br>3. Having narrow screen makes it very hard to use especially when driving. You hardly see whats on the screen. You are not able to unfold it with one hand. Even you do,you cannot hold it with one hand. Total challenge if you want to do something with one hand considering narrow screen. <br>4. Covers are pretty messy. I ended up using only one part of the cover which only covers back part. In that case screen is unprotected. If you want to use covers with it , good luck."
UgzGX0yJkiG3nqJ802J4AaABAg,"I was planning on skipping the Flip 5, but Samsung&#39;s $900 trade in credit for my Flip 4 was too good to pass up.  I&#39;ve never bought a flagship phone for $100 before!  :)"

Ugwoj5fHJPRGNqkRF4Z4AaABAg,They fixed one of the 4 issues that kept me from buying another z fold. Flat folding was one. They need to make it slightly slimmer when closed. Front screen needs to be wider and stylus needs to insert into the phone.
Ugw4sKKDbdoY8BcsqHN4AaABAg,My conclusion: anyone who wants a Fold series phone should just get the fold 4 instead of fold 5 because it&#39;s gonna be heavily discounted

It&#39;s just awkward and the fact that there is not a place for the s-pen...smh. it should also come with the phone like the notes did. Samsung trying to be like Apple and have u pay for things separately I guess. Lol
UgxUKSWGMYotGojRuEN4AaABAg,You don&#39;t seem to be too excited about Non-American brands as you sound for the apple products. Apple products actually also don&#39;t have anything revolutionary new in their phones every year. They virtually copy every innovation done by samsung and just tweak it a little bit to make it look like that they invented it. Apple is so far behind when it comes to innovation like foldable or edge phones. Are you trying to discriminate between American &amp; Non-American brands?
UgyehBrwMlvJL593Czx4AaABAg,Charging 60% of the price for the foldability function is insane.
UgxPhSXr4DKma-Dccgl4AaABAg,"I have pretty big hands and the width of the fold 4 is the perfect size to hold with one hand. If it was wider it wouldn&#39;t be comfortable,  unless they make it alot thinner."

UgyV7fwKi-Y3mVcOnjB4AaABAg,Samsung has the perfect formfactor it&#39;s perfect because they don&#39;t want you spending to much time on that outside display. They want you to actually open it and use it. I already saw a review of the pixel fold and everybody loves the outer display even Flossy said he was loving it. Which results in you opening the phone less and if your not going to open it you might as well buy a s23 ultra.
UgyTq6QKidR_u1YnBgB4AaABAg,Still same old boring samsung
UgwJge5CQ4N2ZzgrsuF4AaABAg,"So when Apple releases an iClone of their last phone with barely an incremental hardware or software update, that&#39;s a good business model.<br>The folds outside screen aspect ratio and the S Pen integration is something that needs to change as that is probably a major change to the manufacturing that would probably mean an almost complete re-tooling which is more than likely why this form factor has remained. <br>Curving the screen on the note 4 edge had a design purpose but the minor curves on the edge of every phone since is the stupidest continuation of the worst idea of hand-held devices, only to be matched by the obsession with glass on the back. The curve edges and glass back create the need for a combination of TPU and plastic protection for the back and edges. The Galaxy S5 managed a waterproof removable  back that allowed battery replacement as well as the cover itself, so to improve on a design that gave user replaceable repairs and upgrades was naturally to stop that and encase the phone in glass."
Ugy9gXubbNX8JUgovyl4AaABAg,"I&#39;ve had Apple basically since the 3GS. But i ventured off when the Fold 3 came out, and god did I love that phone. I loved the Fold 4 even more when it came out, but I slowly started to realize that I HATE Android. It&#39;s so buggy, sluggish, and feels outdated. And since they wanted to be so slow about adopting apps to the Fold style, I switched back to Apple. If i could just get the physical Fold 5 style phone hardware with Apple&#39;s actual OS and ecosystem, I&#39;d be a happy man. Nothing competes with the Apple Watch Ultra and I love me airpod pro 2&#39;s."
Ugy3UyHfHfYNBCyRA9F4AaABAg,MKBHD is one of the laziest reviewers of all time.

UgwDu-3FOfPFx-6UNu14AaABAg,"The flip phone is SO much better than the one that opens out into a square... people... we consume media on rectangles, not squares.<br>Companies actually seem to be holding back, I want a 5 inch square in my pocket that will open out into a 10 inch rectangle."
Ugxpovd8IdcN0BxBYh94AaABAg,Stay away from Samsung brothers n sisters

Ugwnhw_VMv8f3hKl9FR4AaABAg,Please review the galaxy watch MKBHD‚Ä¶. Thanks
Ugzd36x2A78HS8Jw3Z94AaABAg,lol aside from under display Cam. S5 Fold is barely what was promised for the Fold 1. Everyone been buying protypesüòÇ
UgwmEGlet28diEjs0u54AaABAg,"Yep, keeping the 4‚Ä¶ getting the watch 6"
UgzT3Z6b0-z459IRCxV4AaABAg,"I bought the fold 4, it was an amazing bit of tech but so impractical for my use. I just ended up using the tiny front screen the most, but couldn‚Äôt get over how terrible the cameras were compared to my note 20 Ultra (2 Years old when the fold 4 came out) I think as the price is so much more than an ultra, they need to increase the fold screens size and bring it up to ultra camera quality and I would be interested again. Of course, Samsung wont so this any time soon as they will keep it separate product lines, but hence why i see the fold as impractical at the moment. Much MUCH happier with my s23 Ultra ;-)"
Ugwu_Gh6iAQwo0WM-1F4AaABAg,I really wonder why he doesn&#39;t review galaxy watches.
UgzcYAUPiREHA-VaxGt4AaABAg,the amount of hissing is remarkable. could not finish the video
UgxtV0TYMbK2zQjfRnB4AaABAg,All y&#39;all reviewers need to calm down with the design. They made both folding phones for enough years now. This year was the ultimate fine tuning. Ticking alllll the boxes you reviewers have been complaining about AND YOUR STILL COMPLAINING. Next year will be a complete redesign. That&#39;s why they didn&#39;t change a lot on the 5&#39;s.
Ugz7Y1NhRZuFx2GUYvh4AaABAg,Xperia z ultra was cool.
UgzTTuHQBIUQ8oQQE2R4AaABAg,great video .. but these phones (in general) are now extremely boring

Ugz8zu1Ya3mD-0RnVK94AaABAg,"Anda que sorpresa en espa√±ol, gracias Marques like!"
UgzxiEDcX3f_8WQ7wqp4AaABAg,Why don&#39;t they do the other back side a screen too? Then just look what the users do with dual back screens
UgxbEx-qg8MSScVZHjd4AaABAg,All I can say is : HUGE OVERPRICED !!! <br>I use both Samsung and iPhone everyday but flip and fold models are not any &quot;convenient&quot;
UgzZfWGVZMB_O7_Kc394AaABAg,I&#39;ve had an A71 since before the pandemic and I&#39;m thinking about upgrading.  now that I know they put out the same phones 2 years in a row I&#39;ll get one of last year&#39;s models and save some coin
UgzvHqO-5k-d7Mi-rkZ4AaABAg,I have a question I have a 13 pro max and I don&#39;t really use the eco system ( I have the mac m1 but still ) and I was thinking about getting a fold phone but I from my perspective the z flip is not really usefull so I was thinking about getting the z fold 4 cause of the price what do you think ? Is it still a great phone ?
Ugy0VRU4okdIjohPRhl4AaABAg,post-phone age is coming heavy as hell and no company is ready for it
UgyaLqjzn49TVixsbdF4AaABAg,"Z flip 5 has new chip, new hinge and new big display. All hardware upgrades. Thats a pretty big upgrade"
UgxNMWkCK_and-eRk8F4AaABAg,Bro every phone is the same nowadays lol but samsung is still the most innovated
UgwzO_agWI2WCwUq5B54AaABAg,"Honestly I don‚Äôt mind this settling point. Especially because these had so much little non-deal breaker but annoying issues like hinge, tiny battery compared to non-folds and so on. So internal only remodels are worth it if it means it gives Samsung resource to work on internals without worrying about the next big splash page feature.<br><br>iPhone has become this. Every 2 years, the new splash feature drops while some models like the 11 or 13 are revisions for things like battery and durability. Becomes even more clearer when you consider the 11 Pro Max was the most drastic change in battery improvements while the 13 Pro Max was the most durable overall."
Ugz8m23IUIfKdR_k-ld4AaABAg,These foldable phones are very unpractical
UgwNdKEeDx_nZ915UUl4AaABAg,Yow Marcus why don&#39;t you just say it; there is absolutely NO reason whatsoever to &quot;upgrade&quot; from fold4 to fold 5. What a total let down!
Ugw2soW8T89aARs6hJx4AaABAg,‚Ç¨1800 phones... we really are at this point
UgyqJYqZsDiUcW-DSh94AaABAg,"Hi Marques! I see you&#39;ve got a pretty messy brazilian portuguese audio translation. Some of the words are a mismatch and overall experience does not represent the real message that you give in original sound. Would love to see it improving (and even help, if possible). :)"
Ugz5gCA-UyOaw9B28u14AaABAg,Samsung has come a long way ü§î
UgyR1LYLO4p3LzZYN_94AaABAg,Samsung&#39;s have always been letter box shaped. Nasty. I wonder if its so they can still say 6.7&quot; but feel less monstrous in the hand.
UgzlepSDLEvIJP1GyQl4AaABAg,"My Fold 4 just turned in to a brick last week. Crack sound while opening the main screen and there was an ugly black line in the center of the screen and then screen went off completely. Shitty product, stay miles away from the Folds"
UgxU4-JGiaRM-C4k9AF4AaABAg,I want this T-shirt)
UgwOZcc1CRwisRXgIMl4AaABAg,"they need to give the Z-Flip s-Pen capabilities<br><br>I&#39;m one of the few people that actually regularly uses the S-Pen on the Note devices and I&#39;d love to upgrade to the z-flip but I genuinely can&#39;t abandon the S-Pen<br><br>and I really don&#39;t care for the form factor or price of the Z-Fold<br><br>next year, I guess"
UgyPjz-sHo39vJAnhxd4AaABAg,I&#39;m officially done with samsung. Their customer service is terrible. They blame u for all the issues this phone has and they won&#39;t honor warranty.  All 3 of mine ripped in the middle and they said I did it.
UgxuUFo2CPqNREBPa5d4AaABAg,Anyone know where to get the Z flip 5 wallpaper?
UgwRnjs56fQkgF16NA94AaABAg,how mad is Samsung that everyone likes flat corners on the phones. LMDAO
UgwQD0DHvT6od5QI0AJ4AaABAg,I am surprised MB didnt mention or discuss anything about the crease on screen when you unfold it. I thought samsung had completely removed it in Fold 5?
Ugw3kNVpyvFfOWFToH14AaABAg,I like the z fold series but on the other hand I would like to try an iphone
UgzPj-bVRucygRFiQSx4AaABAg,"You just gave them the idea for the new phone, The samsung Passport.."
UgyzTpy4m5W4v-UcbcR4AaABAg,What do you think - Motorola RazR+ or Flip 5? Which one is better?
UgxtmrsjjnRJ4R_D8B54AaABAg,Can I continue to use apps when the Flip is closed just like the RAZR Plus?
UgzbnRTk-GvtYJsB-Ad4AaABAg,Very Apple of Samsung
Ugy-Pw_-gahM23FiHCB4AaABAg,Still can&#39;t imagine why anyone would want a flip phone like these...
UgzXhPU3O2SnxP8ywH54AaABAg,"It was very noticeable what Samsung just didn&#39;t mention when presenting these phones, so you instantly you they didn&#39;t upgrade those parts. However, I decided to upgrade from my 1st Gen. Z Flip, because they offer a storage upgrage, cashback for the old phone and one year of Samsung Care in the first weeks."
UgzmjfM2Se5XBM9HmrV4AaABAg,"i guess i will keep my flip 4 cause the bigger front screen is not much of a deal breaker for me if the newer one doesnt do much except add more to the widgets, maybe they will come with something better for the 6th one, only time will tell, im just glad flip phones are back"
Ugw0wYxLBGIQImN3TSJ4AaABAg,"way too expensive, just got a new fold 4 for 999$"
Ugx8kO8VAItVr4Fi1nV4AaABAg,"The S23 Ultra was also criticized for zero innovation, for looking the same as the S22 Ultra... and later found out that these few subtle changes gave us a much better experience."

Ugxs__dKCTToSljPt594AaABAg,can you review the new s9 tablet pls??
Ugz-3pnpFKnfjhsxKsF4AaABAg,"I am glad that samsung has stopped making drastic changes from year to year, but settled on almost an elegant design on these phone and focused on the core and internal improvements. Galaxy S23 Ultra, Flip and Fold are all the same as last year with minor improvements. However, their main focus has been on software and OneUi and I can really feel the software improvement, stable OS and improved battery life on my S23 Ultra."
UgzUST9YQaCUZspXGj14AaABAg,Hey MKBHD which one do you think is better - Moto razor + or the Fold 5
UgzCnAuxqvg3-ShYORp4AaABAg,"Just came here, again, after watching fpt‚Äôs review on MKBHD and man you‚Äôre absolutely so boss at tech reviewsüî•"
UgyR3SPzMcjcUKgN2IR4AaABAg,"Can‚Äôt wait for Apple to start doing the flip and call it a revolution. If I didn‚Äôt have all my apps and files on ICloud, I‚Äôd def go for the flip. It‚Äôs like going back to the early 2000s but still being up to date."
UgyWddH_LDKo2JdM23R4AaABAg,"I‚Äôm not one of the ‚Äúoh you have an iPhone! You suck because I have an android! Or Samsung!‚Äù I‚Äôm also not the other way around.. I have an iPhone but I also just like cool tech so it‚Äôs cool to see the Samsung phones I really hope this is a lot better than the other disaster. I love what I‚Äôm seeing and it‚Äôll be cool when Apple makes this. I know I‚Äôll be getting one. Except it‚Äôll be $3,000 üòÇ"

UgwZEZ8SHVuM4k9fKbp4AaABAg,"I love the Galaxy Flip phones for convenience. Can&#39;t beat it. I&#39;m in the Samsung Evo system &amp; the Razr+ annoyed me. I missed so much, especially Good Lock. The cameras are definitely sub-par for a pricey phone."

Ugw2Cm8KOkvIcqYzLqB4AaABAg,"I wish Samsung would‚Äôve improved the cameras and battery on the flip, coming from a z flip 3 owner these are easily the weakest aspects compared to normal flagship phones."
UgwXlEPnGLAhiktrp4l4AaABAg,"They will remain same until competitors shows up, which was this year"
UgysTUWLS-HSoVt8e2F4AaABAg,Pixel Fold is not quite there in terms of hardware. But it is the right form factor. Samsung can settle in all they want but they won&#39;t get my money when they have this awkward ugly tall outer display. And that&#39;s coming from someone who ones multiple Samsung flagships and considers their software (incl good lock) the best in the world.
Ugx32p8krVdujSCsnYt4AaABAg,You should sue musk for copying your brand&#39;s logo D:
Ugz_L5g5O6asR_7On8B4AaABAg,"Posted on another post...Did they fix the inner screen protector lifting on the Fold Z.  I have the Fold Z #, and the inner protector has lifted twice now.

UgzoOtvkXk9H1-kanBt4AaABAg,I have the flip 4 phone only issue I had  is the screen protector bubbling.
Ugz8sWunenrsU6MMk2t4AaABAg,"I am totally fine with just chips upgrades tbh. We are at a point where things are so good, that unless we get new materials for a glass there isn&#39;t much to innovate. Would like internal pen storage once pen is better with the plastic screens."
UgxLmF3gNhbVhrdBxrx4AaABAg,"Honestly if they&#39;re just going to commit to these minor improvements, I wouldn&#39;t mind paying a little bit more and getting a Z-Flip Ultra. Bigger battery, faster charging, better cameras, and high refresh rate"
UgzPyKpLt8-mdq-9iXl4AaABAg,"What is my interest in a $1,800 phone?  Zero.  Never going to spend that much money for a smart phone.  Especially when I can get something for a couple hundred dollars that will do more than what I need.  Regarding form factor, a 6 inch screen &amp; standard thickness works for me.  I don&#39;t want a flip or fold device which is twice as thick when folded, just to get more screen size when unfolded."

UgwJFVxnlVLaBqctmaF4AaABAg,still far away from huawei
Ugz6OkTV6neqWD1RN914AaABAg,"Think Samsung innovation gone, nothings different just like on S23."
UgwJaMj8GK_zLRnLor54AaABAg,They really need to fix the issues with the inner display if they want to keep this higher price point. I&#39;m still annoyed that my fold 3 had an internal screen that failed twice before it was even 2 years old. Hence why I ditched the folding phones and went back to the S23 Ultra.

UgyYln551vkVh9JH0_R4AaABAg,"Imo the front screen is really Just for using your fold as a phone, and the rest is ancillary on the front. I mean sure you can watch video, surf social media etc.. But that&#39;s what the inside screen is for. I use my fold for work, so the front is perfect for calling texting you know phone stuff. If I need to use it to access my customer base and other work apps I open it up and boom I have a quality work space easy to use etc..  To me it is two products wrapped up into one usable device."
Ugw9H-JXC-I8YiqEszN4AaABAg,I still have the fold 2. I have been waiting for Samsung to make the outter display wider. I can&#39;t believe the fold 5 has not addressed this. WTF @samsung
Ugy33ZzlRCyBjUOsiS94AaABAg,I&#39;m thinking of changing to the Pixel Fold from the Z Fold 4 instead of going to the Z Fold 5 mainly because I do use the cover display more than I thought I would over the last 4 generations that I&#39;ve been using the Fold. I just like the idea of a solid size cover display. I&#39;ve found the candy bar size tolerable but annoying for many apps that I use IMO. Plus little in the way of a refresh on hardware (besides the chip) and cameras is rather disappointing to me.
UgzkaYphCtVDRQ018RV4AaABAg,Any word on Apple flip phones?
Ugy7ZvAWmak46rDxWf94AaABAg,"Everything is not the same as on the Z Flip 5. If you looked at reviews the cameras have improved, the hinge is improved, faster processor and the larger Flex display will be a game changer. I enjoy your channel but don‚Äôt care for your bias. You praise everything Apple does even though they have been settling in for years."
Ugz9heSRzqS0enXDsKV4AaABAg,Hey you forgot to mention that you can also run full apps besides widgets on the display screen like Google maps and texting all without opening the phone

UgzdtLz_8pfxfcKrf6p4AaABAg,Always a vibe to watch MKBHD talk about Tech when I&#39;m not buying anything
Ugw-wjn0qYs0HFvY58p4AaABAg,"The tall and narrow outside screen is optimized to use with one hand. It isn&#39;t intended to be used closed, the whole purpose of the phone is to be used open. If they wanted to make the front screen to be passport sized or bigger, wouldn&#39;t you just open the phone?"

One thing I‚Äôll give to Samsung they are willing to take risks. And many of them have been fun and interesting and had great potential if they kept refining them. Hope tech gets fun and interesting again for the average person soon."

UgwsiruShSeoZLKGzGt4AaABAg,"I think Sammy should keep what they have and expand the line up. I bet that‚Äôs the plan. Samsung doesn‚Äôt want to go all out until they see significant competition, especially from Apple. Apple hasn‚Äôt shown their cards so it‚Äôs best for Samsung to hold theirs as well."
UgxelWAYyBEJDvk8g4l4AaABAg,Question: why are you always so negative and critical in your reviews when it‚Äôs not an Apple product? You always find ways to gloss over Apple issues and make excuses for them. ü§î
UgzC7O5PJ6zrncjE8Pp4AaABAg,"How about if they would make a phone that you can fold.... twice! So it can be 4X as thick. Seriously, what is the point of these, that extra little real estate for the screen? üòÇ"
UgxoOR5QLUR698N96994AaABAg,I&#39;d say the external screen on the flip is a sufficient upgrade; perhaps dragged down by the fact that motorola always was and still is ahead on this; so samsung is basically playing catch up on a feature they seemed to be reluctant to adopt.<br><br>As for the fold 5; that&#39;s an iterative upgrade if i&#39;ve ever seen one

UgzU5CYx8dIAxGhTgax4AaABAg,Many foldable phone has been released <br>But me still using galaxy note 8 üò©
UgxLC0GEEy__FL-sbfB4AaABAg,"Jesus this is actually pretty sad. I have been a long-time Samsung fan. I keep using their phones despite trying multiple iterations of iPhones, Pixel phones, and Huawei. I had every generation of the S series until S10 and pretty much all notes without the first one, N7 (for obvious reasons), and Edge. I have to say that I think that the 7th gen of these phones felt... ahead. That Samsung is actually trying to do something exciting. Then as you say they settled. They canceled the Note series, just to iterate it into the S series. Trading my N20U for the S22U made me feel no difference, to be honest. Same crap battery life (c. 3h SOT on both - thanks to the Exynos) that absolutely hinders my experience. Since then I&#39;ve tried to come back to iPhones... Meh. Tried Pixel 7 Pro. Battery life is a tad better but still crap. I am starting to worry that there are no innovative phones anymore with stuff that I&#39;d care about. <br>In the days when Huawei was chasing both mobile giants, I felt that there is a good saturation on the market but now... It&#39;s all boring plain stuff. The same battery, cameras, shape, etc despite the multiple voices of reason saying these need to be addressed is just a way of Samsung making more money using the same old tech."
Ugwk-MH9gHj8xziVHqR4AaABAg,Why crease the phone when you can roll out the display like a sliding glass door
UgyZ_id607c2klEKfWx4AaABAg,"Yo, he didnt drag when selecting the images and did some finger claw tapping. What a villain"

UgyO6FkQHLHxs0Gx5_14AaABAg,Idk may their target audience is Rich ppl who won&#39;t mind paying 1000 for 1 upgrade
UgwSXaV-Dm7XmFt7p-J4AaABAg,"The foldable are a joy to use. They have a winning formula, they just need to refine what they have now, and they&#39;ll be some of the best devices ever made. Using the apps optimized for both screens was bliss. I know these phones will do well."
Ugw9koVVzcsyuGZwqX14AaABAg,"Personally I liked the Pixel Fold size all around. But I bought a Samsung Fold 5 instead. First off Samsung has never done me dirty. Then, the thiner folded state is better in a guys pocket. Even if it bulges out a little more, the width of the S22 Ultra was getting old in the pocket. Maybe I washed my jeans too much? But the larger phones don&#39;t fit as well anymore. Only time will tell."
UgwPGHI6wuq46Cew6D14AaABAg,"A lot of focus on the hinge, but the achilles heel of foldable devices is the screen and the fact that it is made from plastic.... Which means that the screen gets easily scratched, damaged and are not durable enough for normal use. <br><br>That&#39;s why i&#39;m not going to buy a foldable before the screen has the same or better durability than a regular phone."
UgwXFBFsLV-_lfJuQEh4AaABAg,"Is it worth updating my fold3 to the fold5? If the 5 is the same as 4, then it&#39;s just a matter of whether their upgrades are that much better than my 3, which is still in great operating condition."
Ugx0CjsiFLWtyobF7BV4AaABAg,Samsung needs to come up with new designs
Ugw8vMp2uuuJiBv_jRR4AaABAg,"I just wish they&#39;d lower the price, remember with the first few generations we thought it&#39;s expensive cause it&#39;s super new tech and required alot of engineering, but since then not alot has changed, specially the price..."
UgzH8g88UePWtwqHAjh4AaABAg,So basically they&#39;re copying Apple by releasing the same phone
UgywoKK6la-FI9PU8nV4AaABAg,I will only get one when they manage to fix the crease somehow.
UgzfX8RbR_DAVSCGkhN4AaABAg,Phones are reaching the peak.
Ugy5WwXjdt8BH8xg_rx4AaABAg,"Maybe Samsung will spread out the price points in a the foldable line as the tech evolves and becomes more widely used.  Standard, plus, ultra like the S-line/Tab S-line. An ultra foldable? Wonder what that would look like? I had a trade in available and preordered the Tab S9 Ultra for home entertainment/media.  Comes in a couple of hundred dollars cheaper in the preorder versus the Fold 5 for me. My phone is good as is, and not just ready to babysit a fold when I take it outside. I live in a dusty world, not ready for any kind of foldable just yet."
UgxKH0VQ9gNOI0_eS_t4AaABAg,I just wish the RAZR had a better camera
UgwgyOb4G5gM7NoecBJ4AaABAg,I love my flip 4. Still debating on upgrading.

UgxJpoeaOcX4ucaRFkd4AaABAg,These phones are giving me Nintendo Gameboy Advance SP &amp; Nintendo DS lite vibes.
UgxlR0WxhNdWml9Z22d4AaABAg,Check back with me when the crease is no longer.
UgyUBWtXLhXK6Y_yCUp4AaABAg,Mmh‚Ä¶Why they didn‚Äôt make a full size outer screen like Motorola? I will wait until they make it before purchasing it
UgwRs308PPkK9wbviLd4AaABAg,crease is yuckkss that make premium phone -- cheap
Ugy9eBku5u59VqZ6evR4AaABAg,Samsung killing it again. Apple died a long time ago.
UgweVh2JScGLNeFGhNR4AaABAg,"I think the tall and awkward size of the fold feels okay, they kinda telling you if you need more screen, just open it."

Ugxn9AZyBQa1HcjIAzR4AaABAg,"Hinge problem is the biggest issue with Samsung,n they kept ignoring this issue fr past 5 yrs."

UgxZugT7XHVRkdk3OAN4AaABAg,This is way better than the boring iphones lmao
UgzELligV7_dM0S-DDd4AaABAg,Flex window is a much more groundbreaking upgrade than dynamic island.<br><br>PS: You can do literally EVERYTHING in flex window without flipping the phone. Good job Samsung.

UgykBQN-NvHcFQ9_KXh4AaABAg,Some exual upgrades are at least a year away
UgzvkZ2F1kT5K3A7II54AaABAg,"I&#39;m DONE with stupid folding phones.  I had my fold 3 repaired for a line down the middle,  and it has another line starting a few months later.  I&#39;m not risking paying $600+ for another repair so im trading for a 23 ultra. Also they put crappy cameras on these, such a joke. They also feel warm if you are processing anything,  no apps fit the ratio,  they are useless. Id get a redmagic gaming phone if they had big cameras."
UgzVmvTbresmCJLh-0V4AaABAg,"In future, Samsung might discontinue S-ultra series or will make them foldable too bcoz there is not much too improve in terms of design in S-ultra series now. And it is also not liable for a company to make 2 similar phones with same specs. To summarise, we can say what happened with Note series in the past can happen with Fold series or S-ultra series in near future. They probably may get merged. It all depends on how folds/flips are getting response."
UgxIq3PxiZTvpSphc2p4AaABAg,"Please talk about the samsung screen issues because it&#39;s alarming since s20 series all of their flagships are having greenlines/pinklines, most of them are happening after 2 years of use, now its happening to s21 series, then what? s22, s23.. because it&#39;s alarming that /&quot;samsung flagships are only 2 year phones"

UgxOPiRVV7i2iCxOhWl4AaABAg,"I own a broken Galaxy Fold 2 &amp; when folded, I hardly used that thin screen, so for me it was more like a tablet I could fold &amp; put into my pocket, then a phone I could open up into a tablet. Now I just use a Samsung tablet F a phone"

Ugz72JqSiXEt5IQO3C54AaABAg,I watched the whole unpacked event. It&#39;s quite depressing to know that ONLY the FOLD 5 didn&#39;t get an introduction video. üòî. Besides folding flat and a new chip nothing else to show off
Ugyz9lInNVneRvbJFOt4AaABAg,"Lets set the record straight. Samsung Flips are a grand fail and should be withdrawn off the market. Reviewers ( influences) rarely test a phone correctly in true life conditions long enough to verify robustness. 3 warranty screen replacements and every single person ive come across with a flip 3 or 4 has replaced srceens under warranty within a year or cleverly being denied replacement screens. It causes huge inconvenience considering the astromical price. Mine just delaminated again, 3 months after the 2nd warranty replacement and to make matters worse,  i needed to threaten with legal action to get the screen replaced. Massive fail. Massively duped by reviewers and Samsung alike. If you use a Flip3,4,5 properly for months at a time as your only phone it will keep failing. I love the phone, love the resolution, love the convenience of the folding advantage but they should be completely recalled off the market and buyers compensated accordingly. Please speak to long term users of these phones rather than short term reviewers many of which are sponsored reviews before you commit to purchasing."

UgzRLus2eVThxzcSWsp4AaABAg,"it&#39;s interesting how phones are slowly and subtly improving their phones every year. We&#39;re reaching the limits of what we can do with this form factor and are curious about the next design. I appreciate that Samsung is the leading phone manufacturer in flip phone design but in all honesty, it&#39;s the 2 regular phones put together."
UgyDm0X1_p4FjCp1ryR4AaABAg,Maybe saving up for the next update and make it BIG. the make what the people like though.
Ugw3SBXI-RAuFLNF4Qx4AaABAg,"These phones are beyond pointless, solving a non-problem with folding solutions. Bizarre."
Ugy_4DhHIh229RM_4sZ4AaABAg,Let&#39;s get to it! If Samsung doesn&#39;t enable snapdragon satellite on this gen 2 chip I&#39;ll be looking elsewhere this year. The writing is on the wall since they did that on the s23.

Ugw5TOpNvDqtn1dtt1V4AaABAg,"I hope they sorted out the shit factory screen protector that delaminates and crushes the folding part of the screen.<br>Samsung are assholes though, and because it was a week out of warranty they wouldn&#39;t replace the screen on my Z Fold 3.<br><br>So, as long as you have money to throw away and don&#39;t care about Samsung&#39;s shitty warranty cover, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a great phone.üôÑüôÑ"

UgyUtFRY8OKd2ThPEx54AaABAg,"i think people also underestimate how nice the weight difference is. I&#39;m currently rocking a Z Fold 2 and didn&#39;t really notice it until it checked out the Fold 4 in a store. Every gram that this thing is lighter makes it so much more comfortable in real life. Yes, the Fold 5 is a very very incremental update to the outside specs. However I do think that&#39;s it&#39;s the perfect generation refining the insides (hinge, weight, etc.) that people only observe subconsciously. It makes people feel safer with a folding phone if they know that the weight difference is not that big and the hinge lasts for the entire lifetime of the phone ... and folds flat lol (they could&#39;ve done that for the Fold 4 at least but hey here we are)<br>I really really hope to see some big changes with the next gen know that they&#39;re refining the entire phone into an overall more natural to use phone. Cause that&#39;s when I want to upgrade hahahahha"
UgzdQCL4IQhnBedU98Z4AaABAg,I think I will upgrade to the Motorola flip phone. I been using Samsung for awhile now and want to try something different. I will wait for Google to release there product before I finalized my decision.
UgxIgrGC2c43EGIQiZl4AaABAg,I like the tall narrowness of the fold it fits in my pocket easier lol then a wider phone like those giant Note 22&#39;s or the s23

Ugxgl88Jf1UzTnOO41R4AaABAg,Very happy with my Xiaomi fold 2. Samsung is lucky that the Chinese companies are not selling their phone outside China. People would be flocking to the Chinese companies for their hardware.

UgzLQLsZ3WxG-ey17E94AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=6m19s"">6:19</a> Google Pixel Fold is KING! (I&#39;m on it rn). Galaxy Fold&#39;s candy bar form is too narrow. Bcuz you&#39;ll still be using the front screen unfolded ... a LOT."
UgyJ0DPQDd_vMWMo31t4AaABAg,I&#39;ll wait till I can slap my phone open say &quot;I&#39;ll call you back&quot; and slap it shut mega hard like back in the day. That was the way.
Ugz--WiX3F6bH7DjE_Z4AaABAg,I guess the best part of the new 5 Series being pretty much the same is that the 4-series should drop in price pretty good. Haha
UgxEBrMQKStBQznvvqx4AaABAg,Some old boomer in Samsung HQ is driving this folding crap line while the young and more sensible employees working under them are frustrated as they clearly know this phone design is crap and no one cares about folding their phones.
UgxATD-CZf8-MqXCw0d4AaABAg,The only thing keeping me from getting a folding phone is Android. Hopefully Apple will eventually release a folding phone or a new mobile OS will come out. I am not holding my breath for ether through.
UgzCeErCzxoYXQu28sJ4AaABAg,"I loved my Galaxy Mega.  So sad when it finally died.  Everything else since then has just seemed...small.   Which is probably why I&#39;m interested in the Fold 5...but $1800?  Damn!!  And every time I look up reviews, there are tons of people complaining about how the hinge is basically made of tissue paper and will break and brick the phone at any point.  I mean, I&#39;m easy on my phones, but if I paid $1800 for a phone and stopped working one day because I picked it up wrong, or looked at it the wrong way, I would lose it.  Probably the single thing keeping me from buying it, tbh."
UgzQLHIdGer6VEKJElt4AaABAg,"I still prefer the tall slim cover screen because my hands are small. I enjoy typing on the front screen , I do not have a case on my phone for that reason."
UgzpLrGkT9PA_ck47Dp4AaABAg,"As there are no smartphone with s pen rather than samsung, i will stick with Samsung üî•"

UgxH9J3R1ZxiIk8d3p94AaABAg,I&#39;m excited to come back in 2033 and laugh at how much this tech &#39;sucks.&#39; I will respond to this in ten years...... If I don&#39;t that means I&#39;m dead.
UgzN63caI5athXI4zDF4AaABAg,"Marques, Z plis 5 is the same as last year<br>Also Marques the iphone has a great design"
Ugya_DXPqVrNyqQu9uB4AaABAg,"Folding phones are like EVs, cool but not reliable. <br>Theyll never last as long as traditional phones."
UgzFwTzLA8e5uqbJt954AaABAg,The Samsung Ultra Tab looks dominate but will it actually out perform üçé IPad is the real question.
UgzxmIj4aPwVEiwCXS54AaABAg,"I&#39;d like to see more discussion on the elephant in the room - the peeling/bubbling screen protector. Those of us who have now experienced that can&#39;t get a straight answer on whether it can be safely removed or why the expensive, official Samsung replacement bubbles again after 1-4 weeks. What&#39;s the point of reporting how great a phone is if it becomes a expensive or uncomfortable to use after the warranty expires?"
Ugxp2woWrAyHOTh8YBN4AaABAg,Can I please have one of those phones? My carrier is Verizon. üò¨
UgzuMtJj-uY9XXdijex4AaABAg,iPhone 15 pro is going to dominate again this year.
UgwW7tjeps2Rcn4zR9d4AaABAg,Man kinda wish they stuck to flip 4&#39;s outer screen size
Ugy3KaxeGHyKEOdcz2p4AaABAg,"Wait, doesn&#39;t the new Galaxy Fold 5 have an under-display camera? Because I can see the camera in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=2m56s"">2:56</a>"
UgwiWRZhXlR01HqwfIV4AaABAg,I ended up ordering a pixel fold bc Samsungs fold is just too tall and awkward.
UgzeMKq37muD7AT3eYd4AaABAg,"Is this guy paid pay apple or something, he said samsing only ever do small updates thats what apple does but he makes out like iphone is so good"
UgysL_7q6kVzV8wPw7V4AaABAg,::lists off 1/2 dozen major upgrades::<br><br>‚Äú‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs ALL they upgraded!!!‚Äù
UgwA9iYgdlsK6AOOj914AaABAg,Samsung is giving 900 dollar trade in for some phones  i upgrade every year !!!!
UgzxZn_lIbuk3dD5qq54AaABAg,I really just want that crease gone. If it can ever be done....
Ugz7L03yajtVUwZMSt14AaABAg,Samsung tryna follow apple making the phones the same with little changes
UgwJq3TrR57l1A0PVq54AaABAg,3 &quot;major&quot; form factors EXACTLY means you didn&#39;t yet settle on anything. Nice animations for that video segment anyway üòä
Ugyh0lMU0TCThQVlReR4AaABAg,Impressive bro
Ugyp0tMdrHTiQDWIKkV4AaABAg,"I‚Äôm considering switching (upgrading) from my Samsung galaxy s22 ultra to Samsung Z flip 5. üòä Is it worth it? I still want to have a great camera, because I take a lot of pictures and videos üì∏üé• What‚Äôs the biggest difference between these two phones? Except from the 100x zoom and the style (flip) obviously. üòâ"
UgzcTXUNO1_pV5shPQl4AaABAg,"Ive been fighting with Samsung for two damn days on this presale and trade in but I cannot for the life of me do it on my phone or MacBook, called in but my damn Apple Card has no fucking readable numbers to give the agent!!! FUCK ME!"
UgytirM1X3SfYAO9LmV4AaABAg,"my sister been holding and waiting for this phone, literally sent her pricing, S23U is $18 monthly, Fold5 is $66 monthly. is the Fold5 3.6x better to justify the price? IMHO NOPE"
UgwAdLvy1LWmQ4H-awZ4AaABAg,Just look how many reviews you&#39;ve gotten for this &#39;Samsung foldable&#39; topic... They dare not to make any dramatic changes
UgzhSCrG5jHmKukj6GB4AaABAg,"Awesome video, man, but I had to watch it in English because there&#39;s only one detail, IA voiceover on Portuguese audio track and the way it speaks is a little annoying because of that. Could you in the future change to a human voiceover? It would be perfect! Hugs from me and Brazil! üòä"
Ugxo9fR6-AdmC0E87RF4AaABAg,"The pricing sucks for such small iteration changes, but it at least isn&#39;t wild like raising it $100+ would have been. Though either would be sound according to business sense (at least at $100 more anyway)."
Ugz9P8rIdolWKhMp92p4AaABAg,"I wanted the Samsung S8 Ultra Tab, but due to it not having the SnapDragon Gen 2 chip it kind of made me conflict over it and compared it with the iPad Pro 12.9 with the M2 chip but with the S9 Ultra Tab having the Gen 2 chip, I&#39;m definitely going with the S9 Ultra Tab."
UgzaUfSZdzQpcwD0Qut4AaABAg,They just need to get rid of the damn mid ripple.
Ugy9IxM-ZyQGMeAY_WB4AaABAg,My first Z Fold 4&#39;s internal screen exploded. A metal shard from work made its way into the hinge gap. The hinge upgrade is needed but not enough for me to change my current phone
UgzsBQsYjOKNIP_1YtR4AaABAg,I had the huge phone but mine was overseas‚Ä¶ it actually had the speakers the same vs you needing headphones. Putting that thing to my head was always funny. It was big but it‚Äôs as worth every penny.
UgwMRqc67NREGJqruaV4AaABAg,bye bye apple
UgzILVi1kznSWJIcX1t4AaABAg,I had a galaxy way back when now an iPad the galaxy seemed like a manual transmission compared to auto in the Apple have they caught up I‚Äôm not so worried about getting hacked as I was but having to go through so many steps to do any thing sucked are they comparable or close to hardly notice any difference? Oh and this my original new thing ‚Äúpeace off‚ÄùüòÖ
UgyADwTUFtiU08UPYaB4AaABAg,Not exiting anymore.. is another phone üì±
UgxLLPOkjKQkUwGlGoZ4AaABAg,The Tab S9 is really catching my eye. I&#39;ve a 2018 iPad Pro that Samsung will give me $500 for + other discounts and I can nab one of those for $200 after tax. Pretty fantastic deal.
Ugyng9QUS1dPseJpp7R4AaABAg,"If only they just change the dimensions of the fold 5, rather than 6.2 folded<br> make it 6.6 or 6.8, that will even make enough space for an S pen, guess wait for next year again."
UgwI94FmYMCisr0DIkp4AaABAg,I am waiting for the folding umbrella screen .
UgxX_DkmX0P3tMUeInZ4AaABAg,Can u text with the front screen of the z fold 5?
UgyZ5FNR8o0e_yGlWEx4AaABAg,"When Apple change nothing, i dont hear anyone complain."
UgwGWAlTLdYMXKn5Tax4AaABAg,"foldables are very impressive from a technical perspective, but i would never pay the premium upgrade, rather the s23 ultra than the fold"

Ugwnb8jkdY8cbJhSox14AaABAg,These phones look weird when person take it out üòÇ
UgyMFXPXNARxHRqnM8Z4AaABAg,"They should make it illegal to make new phones every year, do every two"
UgybNoI8vzu1mXkrZXp4AaABAg,I am waiting for Samsung Z fold ultra xl
Ugy28TFLzZpKU03tRBR4AaABAg,They are offering $1000 if I trade in my s22 ultra. That&#39;s the main reason I&#39;ve stuck with Samsung. It would cost too much to switch brands.
Ugz85ZhFjyZhS696Fyh4AaABAg,"APPLE c‚Äômon! <br><br>Gotta give credit to Samsung for trying something new, while Apple decides it if want iPhones to have USB C charger. Samsung is way ahead, put sadly I still stick with Apple due to privacy. Can‚Äôt beat Apple in privacy."
UgxommmJ_pEXAGFe2Kd4AaABAg,I have had a Note 20 Ultra since it came out and I won&#39;t be trading it in for this garbage that is out now. Not to mention Google is still updating it.
Ugx24MWo1k2YU4A0tU54AaABAg,Exact same shirt you wore in the last video I watched. üòÆüòÆüòÆ Facebook/Indiana Graphics.
Ugz0r3pcuj5LgZ3sXEp4AaABAg,I agree they are settling in...but with the whole samsung ecosystem I don&#39;t need a larger tablet phone if I have a s9 tablet.  But I see where you are coming from.
UgyJim-VC3T2P9fuAp14AaABAg,"Its a foldable phone, its something else !!! To say thats all is an understatement, the tech thats out now is unreal!! Moving way to fast to  appricate whats being made nowadays"
UgyJCA0Fd2Tf0vpz8BB4AaABAg,I‚Äôm not a samsung user at all but you have to stop acting like it is nothing while it is an improvement and the only reason you are saying that because now you‚Äôve got your share in nothing company
UgxvHvXnet0OwwfGFcp4AaABAg,"As a Fold 4 owner, I&#39;m happy with everything however would have been nice to see an improvement to the cameras with the zoom. However the Gen 2 chip should improve the camera output.<br><br>As for a wider phone, Note Fold Or Notebook should be the new model added to the range. Passport sized, in built S Pen, flagship cameras big battery etc."
UgzjXznFq4tJFDkZvUx4AaABAg,"For me to buy a Samsung Fold, it has to contain the stylus within it. Once they do that, they&#39;ll have my money."
UgxkC3NB51XkPOzUzuB4AaABAg,"I&#39;m getting frustrated waiting for Samsung to release the Tab Ultra series with 5G. So far, you can only get 5G with the Tab+ series....üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
UgyFYT4ppGXq5C2zq3l4AaABAg,I&#39;ve been scared of this phone since my Flip 4 broke in just 1 year  üò¢
UgztkfMYB25erpe2Rvl4AaABAg,"It&#39;s just a bit pricey, haha"
UgyY86JkLWn-AvG1bJF4AaABAg,"In the next ipad commercial, apple should really mock samsung&#39;s s9 ultra for that notch to get back at them for their old commercial."
UgwBhCwvG5ytt9_KsjJ4AaABAg,Fun fact : Flip phones are actually fold phones if you turn them sideways.
Ugw95XSEuHkEx15SVB14AaABAg,They are doing exactly what Apple are doing with there phones.They don&#39;t  have much competition in this part of the Market.
UgwOgZdjvtqsNcb6c7N4AaABAg,Why?
UgzbbdweB2ZV1nddf6h4AaABAg,Imagine showing this to a flip phone user in 2005
UgwaTQmZZjXQxTjGVn54AaABAg,When did you started dubbing your videos ? who does your spanish voice ?
Ugw3-zzjNuFcCvBOMbh4AaABAg,"No immersion... same like last year, I mean Z Fold 5<br>Comparing to Xiaomi thin fine, and Honor with all better inside its very poor that Samsung just get rid of gap"
Ugx0If5ZVzIGQ7WhceZ4AaABAg,"I prefer the more narrow folds, because it makes a wider inside screen, which imo is the whole point of the phone in the first place. I personally dont really care for a &quot;normal&quot; aspect ratio for the cover screen because it just makes for a more squarish inner display. I&#39;m not using the phone for the cover screen, I&#39;m using it for the huge inner display."
Ugzi48pMwBp9jgQpbxJ4AaABAg,"2023, the year that Motorola is fun, and Samsung is boring in the hamburger folding phones."
UgyX5-U6nsOAVNlNpv94AaABAg,"The camera of the Z fould should be improved, because they said ‚ÄúAnd this chipset elevates Fold5&#39;s camera performance to the high standards we set with our S series,‚Äù"
UgxPlYDfRK8a2yPxojx4AaABAg,"Hope they fixed the flip from breaking from a 1ft fall, went through 3 of them before getting the s23+"
UgxNvmokQq9SiisfNel4AaABAg,They had extra hardware and left most things the same. Scam
Ugz1C8BTdd3ulRBfqlh4AaABAg,"My problem with the flips is they&#39;re so dang tall unfolded. If they made it shorter just a little bit it would give more leverage for closing it and also allow me to reach the top of the screen comfortably. I wouldn&#39;t say I have below average hand size either, &amp; if marques is complaining abt it on the fold that makes me feel more reasonable üòÇ"
UgyKprxzyO3NVVy6GCV4AaABAg,The flips.. the folds‚Ä¶ and the others‚Ä¶. Animation didn‚Äôt match.
UgwPjky4o5MG7A5J4ah4AaABAg,"Wow within the next 5 year the tech to go will be foldable phones, that will be the normal"
Ugyl20mFjbW84J7Zr2d4AaABAg,"Foldable phone allows for more graphic space, namely videos. If you open the very small z flip 5 horizontally you get a normal wide screen image. If you open the Samsung z fold 5 in any direction you get the same size wide screen image as the z flip 5. Basically there‚Äôs two large black bands on the larger z fold 5, such is the wasteful proportions. Samsung should make the any folding device so it‚Äôs 4:3 or 16:9 when opened. How long before they make a folding tablet or a tri-fold phone? As long as the proportions serve video watching, any other purpose doesn‚Äôt have a proportional need."
UgzSLdDyjUboypn7ZnZ4AaABAg,I get how hard it probably is to get better than last year&#39;s model but they were so bad at the trade-in and the ordering process. The flat s pen with the new case is so awesome I was seriously considering spending the $800 (plus tax) plus the case and s pen but can you believe they don&#39;t have any matching colors of the cases to the new colors of the 5! And finding the cases when trying to add everything to the cart was horrendous. The truth is the 5 is an amazing device but they just turned me off to wanna pull the trigger. I was literally gonna spend $1000 but they are giving so little to make someone with the z fold 4 wanna upgrade. SMH. Samsung could have done so much better.

Ugz5upGVasfqopc8qoJ4AaABAg,O meu durou 20 meses. Tela dobr√°vel ficou com faixa preta. Custa 4500 reais para arrumar. A Samsung oferece 200 reais para comprar o produto quebrado... n√£o fa√ßa a burrice que eu fiz. N√£o presta. N√£o compre.

UgzB-PKtVNvxXYpFo9h4AaABAg,"The fact that both phones are the same price and have nearly identical specs to last year tells me these are more for people still have yet to switch to foldables.  They are just trying to grow their customer base. If it works, there will probably be a more significant upgrade in the future."

UgyI7QwRYj8vjKDVjmN4AaABAg,Samsung has always upgraded this way make a device small upgraded next yr then Major upgrade Then an incremental the following and then a major upgrade Washa repeat that&#39;s all samsung does Why your acting so shocked about it
Ugy1SX-dHdCQNQ01jbl4AaABAg,"What&#39;s the point of innovative if some Chinese phone company copy it in the next cycle, with lower price due to the scale they can do with the manufacturing.  And the Chinese phone manufacture practically have no respect to IP and other copy right stuff."
UgyHzjkHAtJcaWMuBCV4AaABAg,He said it feels smart watchish. What about if this is samsungs ultimate plan of making the flip into a smart watch which can detach from strap unfold and become smartphone !!!!ü§Øü§Ø
UgwbaD-HNnbQrm6ChOl4AaABAg,Comparison between the new fold and the Oppo find n3 flip
Ugzn30l0JdNhyP7a-Zp4AaABAg,"The biggest problem for me with the z fold is the camera. I thought for that price, maybe at least a 108mp and 5x optical zoom with a 12mp ultrawide. The rest is fine. The design is not bad, and then, of course, the crease, but everything else is pretty optimised. The tallness of the phone is just nice, in my opinion, a little like Sony phones. Not everyone likes it, but some people like it, so that is another thing that is to think about."
UgybqRJFhok2rzV8D-14AaABAg,Rollable phones will replace flips
UgyNP5Dly05-bcG4fRZ4AaABAg,What is nitz?
UgwuFcDFG_i57RcUfrp4AaABAg,"Say what you will, but the &quot;update&quot; of the galaxy fold series this year is downright bad.  It is literally the same phone in all of the major ways. An absolute Apple move pulled by Samsung here. A move certain to leave many people, me included very disappointed."

Ugw7hsaaAqba4GZ8CHx4AaABAg,"Necessity breeds Innovation.  Samsung (and most other phone makers), doesn&#39;t have a &#39;need&#39; to do anything unless the competition heats up in the Innovation department."
Ugz_x0TDnt5mxsH9DdB4AaABAg,"I will never, ever again buy a foldable device until they revolutionize the screens to be more durable. Bought a flip and not a heavy user, never dropped it, never slammed it shut and was not a heavy user/. Fast forward 1 year later it had a crack in the outer screen protector, which you can&#39;t take off or have to spend a LOT of money to get it replaced. Ended up trading it in through Samsung for a S23+ for less money of course due to the crack. Such a waste of money. Thanks Samsung."
Ugywj31VES1CpqYr5bd4AaABAg,samsung devices are irrelevant to me now
UgyUPrP5YwG3slK691B4AaABAg,No not this year  may be 9.6 screen like samsung S23  or honor v2  no creed and pen slot  I&#39;m on it.

UgxHiqS87n89CWLwGWx4AaABAg,"Guess I&#39;ll be keeping my fold 2 for another year. I think this is the longest I&#39;ve ever had one phone.  I&#39;m looking at other manufacturers now, and I don&#39;t think samsung care because they sell the displays and make money anyway.  That&#39;s the only excuse for the low effort upgrade path I can think of."

And I have old man fingers. To each their own, as the saying goes.<br><br>Having seen the updates in the Fold 5  I think I&#39;ll wait to see what the 6 brings with it before upgrading. Perhaps by then I&#39;ll need to anyway, though I have to say that after a year with the Fold 4 it&#39;s held up, physically, really well. <br><br>One bright side of keeping the form factor identical in the Fold 5 is that people&#39;s expensive Fold 4 cases should still fit!"

UgyOIEwCsUgKNELGBQp4AaABAg,"I expect top teir cams, s pen slot in phone. S24 equivalent specs or better... the latest and greatest. I want a Fold but the inconvenience of not having an in phone slot for the s-pen and cams on par with the S series, I&#39;m out."
UgzdXQlogAhzv0OPoq54AaABAg,"I like that my Flip Z 4 fits in small bags and my jean pockets, and it doesn&#39;t stick out at all. I&#39;ve had it for a year now, and I don&#39;t have any issues with it. I&#39;m upgrading to the Flip 5."
UgySiQndDPBQsWOP-cF4AaABAg,"So I&#39;ve used Samsung&#39;s fold since version 2 and just traded in version 4 for the pixel fold and  Samsung clearly has the advantage on the software side but as far as my day-to-day use I never want to go back to a z fold. The form factor was just never great for me, the outer screen was always annoying and I found myself always opening it up to use it for anything. If Google catches up on the software side then I think they will be able to steal most of Samsung&#39;s fold customers with the next version of their pixel fold."
Ugxg-9kAMO0M2rHZc9J4AaABAg,"Waiting for the Fold phones to start evolving a bit. Heck, even the Galaxy Ultra range itself needs an improved processor, better efficiency too."
UgzsQO7z8sIR19Tp03R4AaABAg,"Honestly the Galaxy Mega brings back so many memories, I remember how shocked people were at its massive size, asking who would want a phone so big? And look at us now. One thing I‚Äôll give to Samsung they are willing to take risks. And many of them have been fun and interesting and had great potential if they kept refining them. Hope tech gets fun and interesting again for the average person soon."
Ugw6HNj5DvLjmrCb-c54AaABAg,crappy aspect ratio when watching YouTube also
Ugw6ANJOPlyvo6HWRPh4AaABAg,When would you say that &quot;Apple settled&quot; because they settled way back.
UgwMEKwWVf_to8RxtQ94AaABAg,The flip is still too slim when it comes to screen size then need to increase the width. I‚Äôve used it and the keyboard wasn‚Äôt ideal.
UgyOIwWIetXwaBhOhAF4AaABAg,Content on foldables need to open to a screen that has no black bars. So much of that screen is wasted when watching content.
Ugz2oMO_ylgvVU0Utzh4AaABAg,Same $1800 price for basically the same phone feels like they&#39;re abusing their first mover advantage. Sure they&#39;ll keep it for a while but I think this will push more to the other foldable brands in result in long term gradual loss of share for Samsung. And deservedly so.

UgxbV8ZXb-I1sJ0IiJ94AaABAg,Samsung is finally learning from Apple!
Ugzl9qvLONIEXmE_LKZ4AaABAg,"&quot;You gotta name everything&quot;<br><br>&quot;Samsung sheeps&quot;<br>üòÇüòÇ.<br>Perfect for today‚Äôs sammy users. <br>Samsung has now 100% became the Apple of Android world.<br>So, if we are to troll those ios users with &quot;Apple sheep&quot;<br>then, why not the sammy users?<br>&quot;Samsung sheep&quot;<br>Perfectly done, even the under display sensor (fold5) Isn&#39;t changed. What a shame!<br><br>Still, again, it&#39;ll be sold as same as last years models. <br>Shame."
UgxoyUmslcquit1X5ch4AaABAg,"I&#39;ve been saying for years, if there&#39;s no major updates, come out with a phone every two years. It builds anticipation..."
UgxFeO3HvKqqfI5cvaJ4AaABAg,"I personally owned the Fold 2, and am currently using the Fold 3.   My wife had the Flip 4.   So I passed on the Fold 4 as it was incremental, and now it&#39;s just incremental to the 5.    I still see no reason to upgrade.   My Fold 3 is still working, other than reduced battery life from being a little old.    With regards to the Flip, the 4&#39;s hinge was terrible.   It took a 2 foot drop from the couch onto carpet for that hinge to break.    Took it in for repair, and it&#39;s over 300 dollars to do so as the hinge and screen are intertwined.   I have no interest in repairing a phone that she used for 3 months before it broke for it to do it again.   I hope the Flip 5 has fixed the terrible hinge quality, as it was a joke.      I do like my fold 3, and I pretty much only use it folded open with the larger screen.  What I want, is a thinner phone, lighter weight, and better cameras.     If I had the Fold 5, I&#39;d still be asking for those same things."
UgxRQOsIt5VdJB4JlXN4AaABAg,..moto razer 40 ultra is better than flip 5. Nothing else.
Ugw5bgtY2jhYemcsEDB4AaABAg,The password Pliz
UgwHOLGAjQdMgfmG7Lt4AaABAg,"I think the passport sized folding phone is the perfect form factor. Either if Samsung creates a new one or switches the fold series to that, and/or the Google Fold gets better over time, that is the one that I&#39;ll get."
Ugzd3Ym1rCecoiH5OM94AaABAg,"I needed 3 significant upgrades from the fold4 to make this my next phone, and seeing only the hinge upgrade implemented means I am happy to wait another year.  Let&#39;s see some battery/camera/stylus upgrades Samsung!"
UgxsdFJJUWESd8iFFKR4AaABAg,I don&#39;t think they&#39;re settling I think that they was just focusing on getting the screen to fold flat
Ugyxvv-NfYkZ-Y3g_3d4AaABAg,"Don&#39;t care what anyone says.The fact they we have foldable phones is simply amazing. I have the z fold 2, and I love everything about it. I&#39;ve had it for over 2 years, and I will never go back to a regular phone!"
UgxqA43p5_W5hwN0iEV4AaABAg,"They just pulled an apple. Same phone, just a slight software upgrade and a new chipset."
UgztkoJPF8FKi5qBW8t4AaABAg,At least I don&#39;t want to upgrade from my zfold 4. Hopefully next time they will include the spen inside the phone and then I&#39;ll upgrade.
Ugx1X3uUR5fKpNBkn6B4AaABAg,Why is this video is in Spanish!! Remove that now!
UgxMpGHpSfTlJ2aV0Bt4AaABAg,Samsung is becoming Apple they are the biggest company that settles on tech barely any innovation
Ugxcdpn4gySSnT5GS4x4AaABAg,"The wife&#39;s ZFlip4 is just under a year old. Yesterday, she went to flip it open and it wouldn&#39;t open past 90¬∞ !! The hinge has totally failed !!! I have had to claim on insurance. After further research the hinge failure has happened to lots of people !! I would not recommend anyone buying them. Also the built in screen protector is pealing away across the crease causing the screen to look horrible. The technology is just not refined enough yet with foldable phones. I would stay well clear people !!! WELL CLEAR !!!"
UgxSHecSRb4DmVatgpt4AaABAg,put s pen in the phone and take my money.
UgxsX75dbGCh7UCfVWd4AaABAg,The z fold 5 is just a disappointment
Ugy_jJkD5fz63fhHG894AaABAg,"2 years from now, and we&#39;ll have the ideal fold."
Ugy2Vh56rBkEcy83SxZ4AaABAg,Samsung decided to take a break this year. Nothing new at all.
Ugz4Ca51Q01LiubphD54AaABAg,"As a Flip3 user, lack of innovation lets me enjoy my old phone longer without FOMO."
UgxvfQARoNqP9ZVwOx54AaABAg,"Z Fold 5 next to Honor Magic V2 looks like 1000 years old, like first generation...embarrassing..."
UgwDVFmi8_HInfgB4Gl4AaABAg,I was pretty sure I will this summer upgrade from my S22U to Z FOLD5  but now I am total sure I will not...
UgzoIn_fcEDN9bcgfTN4AaABAg,Can&#39;t wait for Apple to do it properly!
UgyUfGBjSb4MyhObHz14AaABAg,They&#39;ve gotta get that 13.4mm folded thickness down to something more pocketable like 10mm or less.
Ugyz2H8brf9pX7Dk38J4AaABAg,"I think this is like he peak price point, the reason they stopped changing is because next year they&#39;re probably going to start updating it to be cheaper for them so they can price it regularly."
UgziYL7gTXW3SEQ45FZ4AaABAg,Samsung is killing iSheeple and forcing them to switch üòÇ
Ugz1mAq89LFJKnDTYhZ4AaABAg,"I do feel this a bit underwhelming, I generally don&#39;t believe leaks but they were hyping up the phones to be the &quot;next big update&quot; when in reality it&#39;s minor, they could of least slashed the price a bit."
UgyH6HVtwMRPMN1WIWl4AaABAg,1750 nits and the same battery......
Ugy41ABXw9cHFIoPgU54AaABAg,"When you already have good stuffs, what major you need? And for gthe same reason, they kept the same prices too. Also.. you are saying as if Apple usually have major updates over there yearly releases of iPhones :D"
UgzkSktu3oTWFpH9FvR4AaABAg,Oohh wow a new larger external screen. Thats it. Not worth the upgrade.
UgzSnXN_N9Eu8Ccm8P14AaABAg,its gonna take A LOT for Samsung to impress this guy...
UgyJcOfZHG8KRg6CZ3l4AaABAg,You complaining how Samsung makes minor changes from one generation to another but talking how iPhone makes exactly the same phone every year.
UgyjZpdy5-W95reIYX54AaABAg,"Amoled DISPLAY is only good for DEEP BLACKS. other than that Amoled is Total GARBAGE, and also WHITE BALANCE in AMOLED is TOTAL GARBAGE, Colours can NEVER be ACCURATE in Amoled, ALSO there&#39;s always Yellow,  Blue, Red or Green TINT if TILT Amoled displays.<br>Colours are Over SATURATED, <br>AMOLED is for KIDS"
UgyxtzPcxtrFyPItiUJ4AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=2m20s"">2:20</a> Why can&#39;t they just make the features they&#39;re giving the flex window on normal phone lock screens? It would be so much better."
Ugz5UP-Es0Ec6XrWurp4AaABAg,Noticeable continued failure to make a difference for such premium price ‚Ä¶ will not buy for sure ‚Ä¶. iPhone 15 + mini iPad will do great job
UgxRq9vPvtTPhC6Mdnd4AaABAg,Samsung smartphone so innovative than boring iphone
Ugy6NMVaLXNLTOy3Pal4AaABAg,Conclusion: not worth it
Ugyc22psUrdDmVsYRz54AaABAg,First thing I‚Äôll be wanting to know is the folding and unfolding of the phone after a while the screen would start breaking or creasing I remember the Motorola razors after a while the strip would finally break after alot of unfolding use
Ugwhw7nyz3c_GwVObk94AaABAg,Lol... They really made them more expensive. Nty
UgyCl1eRfN80XR2LXdt4AaABAg,Currently using the fold 3 and held off on the 4 and from what I see I will be waiting for the fold 6 as there have not been significant changes for me to upgrade. I would have thought that a price drop would have happened since they have yet to push more out of these types of phones. If Fold 6 is not worth it I may switch back to a bar phone
Ugxj2A_lN2dOoozjZYp4AaABAg,For the first time I&#39;m not getting the new fold this year.
UgwcNVHFvZRiV_xVqWl4AaABAg,It&#39;s sooo hard to choose which one to buy! I really need an upgrade from my s20 ultra üò´üò≠ üôà don&#39;t talk about me lol
UgzlxYOTYqEVQ9N8NCh4AaABAg,¬øQu√© pedo con esa voz IA para el ‚Äúdoblaje‚Äù en espa√±ol? Se parece a la voz de Luisjefevlogs y su Jhon Cena üòÇ
Ugy9PSbzrvWx-wY_VN94AaABAg,The problem is that I just bought a Z Flip 4 a few weeks before this Z Flip 5... Fuck...
UgwoUl-uCJfQT9YWA6J4AaABAg,I don&#39;t like to see the folding crease line
Ugzal7xdUJjqUCQ2kHh4AaABAg,Looks like I&#39;ll be sticking with my Fold 3 or moving back to the S2X Ultra series
UgzcORmHci4HALelc3l4AaABAg,If I&#39;m going to pay $1800 I better be able to replace the battery...... either myself or samsung.
Ugxlz9eAdTbWs1tHKnV4AaABAg,"Marques I am wondering why  moto edge 2023 did not get any love it has all the flagship items, and you can get it for 699 right now with 512gb  where the other phone cost twice as much for the same size. Ready-For on the phone and Pc software,  So you can your Phone App&#39;s on your pc and copy you clip-board to your phone or to your pc etc.., and so many other thing, is there any way you would do a Video on the Moto Edge 2023  &amp; software ??? (more then a comparison to other phone&#39;s )"
UgwQl5exD3EKXDUrd6N4AaABAg,Pre order it for my wife if she like‚Äôs I Will buy another one for me üòÇ
Ugw5cUZEgBK4BbH9eid4AaABAg,"Okay, need to hear the s9 ultra tablet pls, thanks!"
UgyHoS8QnwJj0HXzh794AaABAg,I really just wish they would be okay with thicker devices... I don&#39;t need something super thin... I would have preferred the Pixel Fold and the Z Fold 5 to be thicker for larger batteries and/or stylus storage.
UgxcT-VZPkwB43f3J414AaABAg,Compare it to the Honor V2 please üòé
UgxPHRtIob0I-ro_TKN4AaABAg,Lmao remember how iPhones got made fun of for barley making changes to their products. Samsungs turn is coming up.
Ugz3-wu5-elWq1wLK_94AaABAg,i like them
UgxjM4H48l2RjiXDc0x4AaABAg,"To me this phone has ethical dilemmas: if you make such big phone (environment unfriendly), such big box, why not add small quality charger.  I feel these companies are cheating therefore wouldn&#39;t buy till I need it"
UgzEkZOJvGK_fvi4Sz54AaABAg,"It would be cool to see two gorilla glass panes on each side of the inside of the phone and in the middle use the same plastic/glass thing that fuses with the glass on each side, this way it will be more durable? ü§î"
UgyrLClzZlOkPVIgz2V4AaABAg,I was so excited when I got my Fold 4 and now it just seems like the same thing every year
Ugz_C_2LV6xRpipS5_J4AaABAg,The new cover screen on the flip is just ugly imo.
UgznxbLw8Zq-JlgzjBx4AaABAg,Shame on you Samsung
UgzCH9edAqGs13itQyx4AaABAg,That tablet ain&#39;t a tablet. That&#39;s a monitor with touchscreen.
UgxqKE95s0dWlRh6JmR4AaABAg,"Honestly I&#39;m just happy we have flip phones smartphones. They&#39;re revolutionary, and while hopefully all these brands won&#39;t get into the Iphone habit of releasing newer models that are basically useless, I&#39;m fine."
UgwwRpKqt4WeLukKbHh4AaABAg,"A real upgrade would be to make it compatible with a stylus. Please Samsung, just give it a stylus."
UgyRK9mqJJh_rLxQyQh4AaABAg,Still going strong with my Fold 2......
UgzHsvdkdfss278422J4AaABAg,I&#39;m not going to lie; this foldable phone generation is starting to grab my attention!
Ugyzy91ySpkfPJ8RNoF4AaABAg,"Those are some expensive phones for what they are, I guess because they&#39;re double the width of a normal phone it will be annoying to put in your pants back pocket. ‚Ç¨1200 for the cheapest Flip and ‚Ç¨1900 for the cheapest Fold, lol!"
UgxBWwkS-Wu-FHXcKbp4AaABAg,"I just wish they would improve the camera. I have the Z Flip 3, and the camera quality just doesn&#39;t compare to other phones out right now."
UgxPZAndVXgLM5WMZx54AaABAg,So the small screen still only displays the widgets? üòÇ
UgxN5SngpIzMJ7zJA814AaABAg,"Samsung is doing settle changes just like apple which is good we don‚Äôt need crazy changes every year, like the camera they could‚Äôve updated it but maybe they will on the next fold 6"
UgwQtIVfVqH6RYsuBNJ4AaABAg,BS updates for more money
UgyIrfh2yTBhPrIGt1F4AaABAg,You know what I&#39;d like to see next?<br>A folding watch ‚åö
UgxczGmD3vWMJ-bU51t4AaABAg,"Pls for the love of God they really need to make that cover screen wider and either symmetrically rounded corners or symmetrically sharp ones, none of that one curved side and one sharp side I hate it‚Äîit&#39;s literally the only thing holding me back"
UgzVIp4R-soZqqXw1zN4AaABAg,And people say Apple doesn‚Äôt make any changes üòÇ
UgzgDeLIf3yJn4PpIiJ4AaABAg,"When they fix their warranty process and the center crease cracking over time (and them refusing warranty claims for false reasons), I might consider getting another Samsung phone. Until then, I&#39;ll be stuck with my Fold 3 which is slowly failing because they refused to fix their major issues."
UgzNWfsH0lDkFHr7t1d4AaABAg,I have the flip 3 and I&#39;m getting the Razr.
UgwsaXHTXRGHWtBy9qx4AaABAg,I&#39;d love something like this but even if I had that sort of money I wouldn&#39;t buy it. I&#39;m  sometimes a bit mishap-prone and things get dropped off ladders etc.. I&#39;d be rather upset if I&#39;d spent all that only to wreck the display within weeks of purchase!
UgwiZUdENJyjZYqDqrp4AaABAg,New cover screen.<br>New hinge.<br>New chip.<br>New base storage.<br>Fast UFS 4.0 storage.<br>New faster RAM.<br>Up to 512 GB.<br>Man... you are not reliable on this Z Flip 5.<br>Espacially as Apple owner.
UgxAEVF8q4Acxo5kbKF4AaABAg,"I would own a flip or fold if the prices were reasonable! I understand 5 years ago the tech was new and was a premium thing, but the price should be coming down, but due to greed, it&#39;s staying the same with very small upgrades year on year. Like why can&#39;t they widen that cover screen in the Z Fold? Everyone wants a wider screen. If Google can do it, Samsung can. They need to listen to their customers."
UgyaiHOOJ2EP1DtmMdd4AaABAg,If these were apple devices it would have been a +30min vid.
UgwH0yC4Zcja7I3TKf94AaABAg,i love the tablet
UgyRNQwHdSMVSaaCNLV4AaABAg,whats you opinion on the Razr to the flip 5
UgwN9uYjon2QGk6y2pV4AaABAg,"Its ok, iphones will be a huge disappointment again"
Ugy8GavQuLFbkOjAXP94AaABAg,On the flip I heard that the lens for the main cameras was different
Ugw2sYh2Y3oeweaNXON4AaABAg,Probably going to add a major update on the fold 6/ flip 6
UgzsTGbAOVt8S6fOdzR4AaABAg,"Hi MKBHD, <br><br>I love the way you breakdown your analysis and all the depths you explore around the tech and tech design of devices.<br><br>But I&#39;ve a love hate relationship with your channel. You do have the latest and most relevant reviews. But because of my bias against Apple, I can very clearly see your biased filter against Android.<br><br>Both the platforms and approach and there isn&#39;t a direct comparison most of the time. But you clearly have an extra critical lens towards any major Android launches and there&#39;s a different excitement in your approach during Apple launches.<br><br>The way you approached with zero cynicism about floating island that disrupts any sort of media consumption in iphone&#39;s design and the way you cynically approach any of Samsung, Sony or Google&#39;s design choices is quite different.<br><br>For you It sometimes feels like Apple can do no wrong.<br><br>Just a review about your reviews."
Ugzaa3P6oMDTaVLTfEJ4AaABAg,I am waiting for a flip with more size. Who will paid so mutch to have a normal phone when you open it!!! A flip ultra with 25% size could be a very good phone.
UgwgJdh1JtDZ1UoJgFB4AaABAg,I had forgotten about the. One edge. I liked that phone
UgyEFqWs0YJHQwoPwPF4AaABAg,una nueva bisagra mejor con menos partes y que cierra mejor es mucho muy importante con la mega pantalla externa diria que cambio mucho ademas del procesador.. que mas queres??
Ugz94y5nhwUAfZ-crzJ4AaABAg,I rather wait for the honor vs 2
UgxtiEHgW3zJGum015t4AaABAg,waiting for apple make this trend.
UgztpWvyL6AC2fs93wp4AaABAg,Hey boss. I got the Spanish dub by default. And while it does its job I guess. It&#39;s not really nice to listen to. I&#39;d recommend you Google Clouds text to Speech instead. Sounds way more natural than this. <br><br>Spanish is my first language btw.
UgzM7qJoJYkqymAFyB94AaABAg,"Saint internet. <br><br>Like making homo deus. And like what does MKBHD even get. <br><br>Like I know I‚Äôm a pain but like can there be something on books like higher Ed is problematic but like they do research and have resources that like YouTubers don‚Äôt even look at. Chris miller, jake bittle, dr. Dorothy roberts, dr. Jasmine brown, heather McGhee. <br><br>And yeah there is technology so advanced that like probably most can‚Äôt afford but like we can still have a space of what are the things we want to talk to each other about. <br><br>As Sam sanders says obsess better."
UgzPjVW7UyANc8DQ7hx4AaABAg,"Hopefully the s24 will bring something new, my s21 is barley hanging on. Hoping to get 144hz screens üòä"
UgwgT-R96l4G6FDKh0x4AaABAg,No folding phone manufacturer should be happy with year over year incremental updates. The Flip looks nice but you get more functionality from the Razr. They sure did settle
UgyvzAUvQrfPuIpG5Ux4AaABAg,"You can do one for Honor Magic V2 if you get one. That looks like the potential ‚Äúbest foldable‚Äù this year. Compared to that, Z5 just seems to have the only advantage ‚Äî it‚Äôs being sold worldwide."
UgxGSKJ6C_8Rl-Ju6ch4AaABAg,@mkbhd can you make a video on the galaxy watch 6 series
Ugynv2Yj5q_VjDN45rF4AaABAg,I like this. I might consider dropping iPhone for the Flip 5. I like compact nature
UgxyUahXcZSPRyPIBQt4AaABAg,‚ù§
UgyOwnYZdQwR6tys7Nd4AaABAg,I own the Z fold 3. I will only upgrade my phone when they get rid of the crease. üòäüòäüòä
UgwG59AOX9VISBNX91B4AaABAg,"I‚Äôve always been a flip phone lover but been using iPhone since the 3G and l‚Äôve been on the iPhone XS MAX since it came out 5 years ago.<br><br>So‚Ä¶camera wise, will either the Z Flip 5 or Razr 40 Ultra/Plus be an upgrade for me? If I‚Äôd been using the latest iPhone I guess these flip phones is a down grade."
Ugw-eN-vAnGbe3lYUsZ4AaABAg,"I gladly watched this video to the end, despite not wanting to ever get another Samsung device again.  The fact that all Samsung devices have updates that are mainly aimed at degrading the device experience, makes me go wild (not in a good way). <br>Worst of all is that the updates are persistent and consistent, the owner of said device cannot remove the reminders, cannot replace the OS and are stuck with a device that by its very existence is deliberately being downgraded every week by the people who made it.   <br>Marques, your videos are sweet and with every week, they get better ;-)"
UgyJUvHdXv7QY5Bne7l4AaABAg,Apple puts out phone with insignificant updates for 3 years straight - &quot;Best phone you can buy&quot;  <br>Samsung puts out phone with insignificant updates for 1 year - &quot;They settling&quot;
UgwCygLO98n1DITxwoJ4AaABAg,Flip phones are still the worst idea ever.
Ugz2b6dva9bRN_zxoIx4AaABAg,More Glass to Break üòÖ
Ugwt93NhhND11zrjRFt4AaABAg,I will stay with my  Z flip 3 and Z fold 4 no reson to change it üòÖ
UgxpA1ptdAVFE3KWKCd4AaABAg,S23 ultra user here s8 gen 2 for samsung is the best
UgxLdMB9OMHXsIAONxV4AaABAg,No headphones jack so I don&#39;t care how good the phone is
Ugx_TOOUae1fiwKlhzB4AaABAg,I don&#39;t understand why they didn&#39;t just release a Z Fold Ultra with beefed up specs - there&#39;s a market out there for who just want the best and it wouldn&#39;t have been hard for them to do. <br><br>Wonder how much business this video has lost them! They should do better!
Ugx_xgjpnLEtPYghnuV4AaABAg,"I imported the Oppo fold and honestly I like it better then Samsung&#39;s fold, and the crease is barely noticeable"
UgzpHYJ0SiqXbeyaxpV4AaABAg,"Does Z flip has asymmetrical bezels, broader at corners?"
Ugx_fusDijCM9Yiz5uB4AaABAg,Samsung &amp; Apple using the same toilets üöª
UgzDY9OQcqTfPLmbnjV4AaABAg,"Tab S9 ultra is great, meanwhile taking out iPad Pro and still using it as daily driver"
UgxFCF3DcxvMqJfWr6h4AaABAg,"The Galaxy Fold would be so much nicer if it had the wider display on the outside, like the Pixel Fold."
Ugw5_HcshvaI9IY0xRd4AaABAg,Why are they using Z in their name? Do they support killing of Ukranian civilians?
UgzURtT3AC0-Lk-4RIx4AaABAg,You see how small the flip is when closed? That&#39;s how small I want my phone to be. I have no interest whatsoever in a large phone. Modern phones are mental.
UgyrfWsMXjyjtqlGvm14AaABAg,At this point all they missing is spen in phone. The tablet looks cool but ipad are the best tablets.  Iphone sucks ass tho
UgzzREqZEFAXpKUw2tt4AaABAg,que fea se oye la pista de audio espanola xd
UgzSoWXGxkK2jgrg9BN4AaABAg,"It&#39;s the little things that make a big difference. Didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever get on the foldable phone bandwagon, but here I am."
UgzO1TjnHpcFwil7v8N4AaABAg,Samsung never disappoints with their foldable devices!üî•
UgzImkeLnVQ0Oj-XJ-94AaABAg,"idk seems like more meaningful changes than apple makes year in and year out. the new hinge is huge....thats a lot of engineering and testing. and the phone is smaller overall. cant reasonably expect to increase battery size (or amp hours) and reduce size unless battery tech changes. new socs. new screens. new glass. more storage for base price. people who want new cameras are weird imo. who cares, get a real camera if youre a photog. new pen too! more compatible software!!! doesnt sound like settling to me. and why expect pricing to go down? the google pixel fold is the same price. apple pro starts at 1k and doesnt fold or make big improvements every year"
UgzV9gqNaybru_sXUZ14AaABAg,"Hardware wise Fold 5 not the best (apart from flex folding en durability), but it blows any Chinese version out of the water when it comes to software. So much more productive and refined."
UgwObgjfjSWChUSAjvV4AaABAg,Fold 5. Front camera. 10mp without autofocus. 4mp camera. Horrible.
UgxnRroIZ_7ZwkmnRtt4AaABAg,"The only reason why Samsung upgrade the flip 5 front screen and the hinge to close flat was to keep up with Oppo and Motorola. <br>Huawei was the only innovative company before that the rest had to keep up. Now with Huawei no longer in the competition, these guys are back to being idle."
UgxdWHhjhNJDiQICGaB4AaABAg,Can you use the Spen on the outside screen?
UgyU67a8v9nz0rtKOLB4AaABAg,You forgot to mention the heating improvement as compare to fold 4
UgwClks3qjlOyvgG5C14AaABAg,"ok now that they settled, Can we have better battery? I dont care about new features. Just give me double the capacity."
UgzRy-vAAk7Az08MJD54AaABAg,Don&#39;t expect Samsung to honor the warranty. My fold 4 inside screen broke after 287 days and they refuse to fix it
UgxePoOg7CIOf7U39n54AaABAg,It sounds like it&#39;s a pretty good phone. Not releasing a phone isn&#39;t a bad thing. One can hope that translates to more time developing the next big update. We&#39;ve seen this in other industry. The worst thing would be removing features. The maintaining the price point is fine.
UgwxL5hiSccXEBzKC1d4AaABAg,"The Flex Window animation gave me years of life <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=1m33s"">1:33</a>"

Ugw1vqZzdmjghtvvg_x4AaABAg,I&#39;m great fan of marquis tech videos
UgzUsidwFEVWCqgsrgF4AaABAg,I might wait for the pixel fold 2. Fold 5 does not tempt me that much like the pixel fold.
UgzyrRsTEarUcFihi5l4AaABAg,Fold5 is only $100 when you trade in a fold4 and I am tempted...
UgzlRajTGDmucL3tjth4AaABAg,They didn&#39;t settle. They started finally milking Foldable phones
Ugy8JMFBXRZMw_8_wz54AaABAg,This new S Pen looks so stupid. The tip is just WAY too thick to actually tilt with it...
Ugw41PWKYr4HKy72JEt4AaABAg,It&#39;s $100 for me to go from the Zflip4 256gb to the Zflip5 512gb. I&#39;m not excited with the minimal upgrades. The front screen is what I&#39;m looking forward to the most but the Razr+ does it nicer. Still for $100 it seems worth it.
UgzkqsKc-XW976fXseh4AaABAg,"Come on man they got a folding phone, two of them in fact."

UgwhRCfT17HMv0vpIlt4AaABAg,I prefer my Razr 40 Ultra.
UgzvLm0w6OW_zkiJKQR4AaABAg,This just shows you how the general public will just fall for anything. These companies will remove features and give you less and market a product as new and innovative and charge you more. They are basically repackaging a product with a new chipset and reselling it to you. As long as people continue to purchase they will keep selling. Won&#39;t be me.
UgzqblBGBqINaF41SVt4AaABAg,If they put a built in s pen. I&#39;ll go back to the fold
UgyCh6wxluJAajYemFJ4AaABAg,Making the outside screen of the flip that much bigger but almost no more functionality is a strange choice... are they afraid of giving us the full experience like RAZR?
Ugw37Z1KoBgg0F3vZlF4AaABAg,How come you already have those phones? They&#39;re not yet at the market.
Ugxd7Ms1ZZHuXAnuw7N4AaABAg,They should make the fold mini
Ugy5i3xEWTY9QZfl6dZ4AaABAg,I will buy a fold when it has an equal or better camera array. I&#39;m hoping for a zfold ultra
UgyuMMauE1FT2lkbwMJ4AaABAg,"Dont care, im not spending 2000.00 on a phone. Ill stick with my Note 10 plus"
UgzGNE97NcFrdLmnyep4AaABAg,I love the z fold 5 and z-fold 4. But to me it is too narrow for me at this point in time it should be wider.
Ugyio280Pvjw_kcO4z54AaABAg,Watching on my fold 4.. the media consumption on inner display is addictive... trust me
UgwOTSF8rXeB_FQb4U94AaABAg,"Holding on to my s4 then. Seems the biggest improvement is the brightness capacity, but 1000 nits is pretty solid outside of super sunny days"

UgybR5cFQzAoNvu4NcV4AaABAg,"from your video it clearly show you are being biased to Samsung. A nice smooth way to say Samsung dont have huge improvement than last year.

Ugyai_cVqRH85XWSNgF4AaABAg,"But as they pointed out in their Ad &quot;IT IS RIDICULOUS UNTIL IT IS NOT&quot;  and that is absolutely true. Look at all the ridiculous stuff that we have become used to that once would have been scoffed at. Sometimes you have to risk being laughed at to actually innovate. And I mean actually innovate, not just lie and call it innovation."
Ugz8M6-gQEwLF06GzPZ4AaABAg,HOW does it not hold a S pen.....
UgyZnMm3DO_SCtffQEh4AaABAg,"having the fold 3  and I agree the thing is too tall, wouldn&#39;t mind having a pixel style Samsung phone where its easier to type. I see no need in upgrading my fold 3 and if I get bored, I can just swap it out for my note 20 ultra or s22 ultra as the phones still work great. ill only upgrade when i see major improvements that are worth upgrading, the same goes for my big ultra tablet."
Ugz-RnHz3xDwkXM2n5p4AaABAg,I&#39;d remove the underscreen camera (makes the phone cheaper) and use that space savings to try and make the pen go inside the phone or make the battery bigger
Ugww722rDa6qMn85f4Z4AaABAg,All i want is for a fold that has pen storage inside of it.
UgxGDsCa7ws3Q9uo4cB4AaABAg,"Shame that we cant compare the fold 5 with huawei mate x3 because of one thing , it does not support Google store , but on hardware level , clearly x3 is superior , competition would have been  very good in this space"

UgzwJga5om2qUI1CVFp4AaABAg,"After careful consideration, I have made the decision not to purchase another Samsung Fold in the future. While my current Fold 3 has served me well for nearly 2 years, I recently noticed some cracks in the middle of the screen. Unfortunately, Samsung refused to fix my phone under warranty, citing the absence of a screen protector as the reason. The screen protector had started to peel off, allowing dust to accumulate behind it. This experience has raised concerns about the durability of the foldable screen.<br><br>If any issues were to arise with the screen in the future, I&#39;ve heard that Samsung&#39;s warranty coverage might not be reliable, which has shaken my trust in the brand. When investing in a premium phone, one would expect to receive premium support and customer service. As a result, I&#39;m now hesitant about considering another Samsung Fold"
Ugxu3VwHG8didgQMpbh4AaABAg,Where the F is the bespoke edition of z fold 4 and z fold 5?!
UgwE7OOVDTaeafvp_nx4AaABAg,That‚Äôs pretty funny that the 3.4in flex window likely has more screen real estate than the main 3.5in screen on the first few iPhone models.
UgxUFdFSIcwj8k32DAd4AaABAg,"The one thing that will always put me off foldables is the plastic screen. I would much prefer the form factor of the Surface Duo, with 2 seperate glass screens, if they can work out how to get those screens as close together as possible, then maybe we will have a proper glass screen &quot;foldable&quot;"

UgzUDSDR54MnwS45w954AaABAg,"Samsung may have pioneered folding phone, but they&#39;ve gotten lazy comparing the innovations brought by chinese companies"
Ugz0Zm0dI4vxIM8YOYp4AaABAg,The difference is not a factor to upgrade. Pointless they launch the same thing with a tiny upgrade for new... no way
UgwDSTNcoG6KNNtjyHd4AaABAg,I love the thin folded state of the Samsung folds. Thin one handed phone with option to open the to a huge screen
UgyohlCog8_jfHE_xUt4AaABAg,"Funny these comments. When apple does this, its a drama! Now samsung does this, it&#39;s perfectly normal üòÄ"
UgyiGJ58av-kQAktUU94AaABAg,not only does Samsung&#39;s folds have poor autonomy - the cherry on the cake was 25 watt charging in the new fold 5 (despite the fact that in Ultra c23 - at least 45 watts). It&#39;s like spitting in the face.
UgzMzSpIu-0xyR2Oj6t4AaABAg,This is a really biased video and I did NOT enjoy it. It is almost like you work for iPhone or any other Samsung competitor and you are trying to make Samsung sound boring. While mrwhosetheboss has no biases. He just explains everything in an exciting manner. He does not repeat &#39;and that is it&#39; &#39;these are the only things changed&#39;.
UgzEfhOQWmqDK6k2gbl4AaABAg,maybe you should mention one more time that there are no big changes to be found here while they are transformed into 1st world problems.

UgxvDFgNCAqIszbZN0R4AaABAg,"They don&#39;t need to make significant changes because loyal customers don&#39;t desire that, and many don&#39;t upgrade every year since phones have become generally good. So, all they have to do is improve it slightly each year and experiment with new features, and people will buy it. If not the customers from last year, then probably those from the previous year or the year before that."

UgykPB5QByaHJA5_QLV4AaABAg,"MKBHD (Marques Brownlee) wears a t-shirt with the number 30 on it, with 24 and 60 between. This is a reference to the number of frames per second (FPS) that a video can be played at. 30 FPS is the standard framerate for most movies and TV shows, while 24 FPS is the standard framerate for most Hollywood films. 60 FPS is a higher framerate that is often used for video games and some high-end video cameras.<br><br>MKBHD has said that he prefers 30 FPS for most video content, as he believes that it provides a smooth and cinematic experience without being too jarring.

UgykYBqT2IpGH5jGh8h4AaABAg,"My issue with the folds is that the technology for the screen is still not really there for daily work in my opinion, way to soft. But it gets better every year. I feel sad for the fast movers with the first versions. They payed a lot and were outclassed one year later, sort of like with the first appel watch."
UgxdF7RiBRVRnypdV9F4AaABAg,Im using the flip4 now and I love it. I dont think I will ever go back to non foldable phones. Yes its more narrow and longer but I like that. Its easier to hold. I dont notice the crease at all. You mostly touch the bottom of the screen anyhow. Even though the changes on the flip5 are minor I really like the way it looks. That hinge is impressive! And I love that the screen on the outside got bigger. I actually prefer it over the motorolla one where it &#39;covers&#39; de cameras.

UgxqKW-7krH-cVmmubh4AaABAg,What I think they‚Äôre doing with this upgrade is they were so close to huge upgrades whether it be battery or the stylus being inside the phone but they weren‚Äôt close enough to perfection to go public with it so I think the next gen of folds not flips is gonna see a massive upgrade all around I‚Äôm sure Samsung won‚Äôt just make a small upgrade and call it a day 2 years back to back they‚Äôll change it I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be more refined possible even cheaper and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm excited for the next gen s24 as well since it‚Äôll have a huge update

UgwTTOn_AVYItirT7Wl4AaABAg,"This is great news, I was deciding between F5 and pixel fold. Going with the pixel"
UgyfOVO64tiyRMOnU8N4AaABAg,All they did was essentially took a fold 4 and stuck a new CPU in it and moved the led flash and called it a day. I swear Samsung have just gotten lazy and have completely stopped innovating now and day&#39;s when it comes to smartphones !!
UgwLNhEe2c032dy1H014AaABAg,They did well. Still sticking to the S series line-up as they&#39;re cheaper and better in most field than the gimmick phones.<br><br>My S23 Ultra is well enough for me until 2026 hits.
UgxhAjqSmh3Psyrccmd4AaABAg,"Man calls out Samsung for releasing a new generation of flip phones with some refreshments and small improvements this generation. Meanwhile calls the new iPhone &quot;generational&quot; every time, he either has a preference or just got caught in the Apple marketing. Apple is the king in making small improvement and add stuff that Android had for a year or 2 and call it fancy words and everyone instantly thinks it&#39;s amazing. What marketing can&#39;t do"
UgwvMyt8r2CuEaRbT7N4AaABAg,"As a flip 4 owner, mine has just started turning itself off when its folded. Samsung also refused to change my screen protector when it creased because debris had gotten under it and dented the fragile screen underneath. They wanted to charge me hundreds of pounds to replace it, not covered by warranty. Because the screen is dented, it has void the warranty, so I can&#39;t even be bothered with sending it in for the repair because I know they won&#39;t fix the issue. <br><br>Some of the worst customer service and support for a device I&#39;ve ever come across"

UgzwDwdOyObRlcC5MvZ4AaABAg,"Carrying a Fold 4 since last year. The best thing about it is the novelty and amaze when you pull it out in public and in front of the people.

UgzyXbyYR8rANhgkIph4AaABAg,Ha! Got the same watch strap :)
UgyLMVxEUmPrWfZHQtV4AaABAg,if they&#39;d match the width of the flip for the outside screen the fold would be perfect IMO
UgyXHPq1At0zxqjIsAN4AaABAg,"As and old school and new flip phone user, for me is all about opening the phone to use. There&#39;s something  nostalgic  about opening a cell to answer calls like back in the days... plus the lil screens remind me of beepers and pagersüíï."

Who actually wants them?<br><br>I realize there are people for whom price doesn&#39;t matter, but I feel like that&#39;s not a big enough audience for Samsung to target.<br><br>So then why would a person in the market for a flagship buy either a phone with worse specs for the same price that folds to be too thick or unfolds to be a fragile regular phone with a crease in the screen or worse yet, a way more expensive and less durable android tablet (remember those things no one cares about?)? I don&#39;t know. I just think they really wanted this to be a feature that let them raise the average selling price of the phone but I just can&#39;t imagine a normal person wanting this over a typical bar phone.<br><br>Android tablets have been so neglected that if they are trying to go for productivity, it just won&#39;t work for most people due to how locked down mobile OSes are and how neglected android tablets are.<br><br>If they are going for entertainment, who would take the downsides just for the rare occasion you&#39;re watching a movie in public and also would take the durability downgrade and awkwardness to hold over a traditional bar?<br><br>The bigger market I think they&#39;re after buys phones every 2 to 4 years. They want a durable phone that will last as long as they use it.<br><br>These phones are not only not that, but I just don&#39;t see the big draw and frankly hope they don&#39;t push them so hard it becomes the standard."

Ugy1Q3e7GqpyO8Wzr014AaABAg,Why?

UgxWa7c7PpyrxWTB8TN4AaABAg,"I mean you also dont need to try the selfie camera in indoor lightning while standing front of a light source <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=07m00s"">07:00</a>"
UgwIrd03spMw1vdcW414AaABAg,It comes with &quot;Free Green lines&quot;
UgySRARS003Xyha-1cd4AaABAg,"What is like using these foldable screens for 3 years on regular use? Also, can‚Äôt wait for a head to head between the Razr + and the Flip 5. Love from India.‚ù§"
Ugxemkoyab_yCoILqbZ4AaABAg,Can you have 4 multitask screens at once on the new fold 5?
Ugw03reewM_f97_oZ_l4AaABAg,I found the Fold 3 for 550 locked on verizon refurbished months back. I just think how much I lucked out as I watch this video.
UgxK4jTO5wQnnI_9Mx54AaABAg,But why are they still running Android 11?
UgwC-DlwfA1_esh9Nf94AaABAg,"Dunno if I&#39;m in a minority but I&#39;ve had the Fold4 for a full year now and I&#39;ve hated every second of using it.  The narrow screen is too narrow, and the large screen is awkward to hold, awkward to type on, and neither 16:9 or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=9m16s"">9:16</a> content fits properly so you have this huge screen but a better viewing experience on something like a S23U.  I even splashed on the 1TB model thinking this would be a keeper but I cannot wait to get rid."
UgxhwH6fNykRiOD_QTt4AaABAg,"Samsung could&#39;ve easily made the fold 5 fold from top to bottom, and the outer display would&#39;ve been useful like a regular phone.<br>Can&#39;t wait to ditch my fold 3 for the oneplus open instead once it comes out. Sorry, but not sorry, Samsung"
UgwdTv_c2Y9LwyfRT_54AaABAg,I uave a Fold 3. My only complaint is thr durability. My wife has the same and the big screen  went out. Replaced with insurance.  My screen protector has split and they are slow about getting replacements out to YouBreakIFix so Im trying to make do with this crack down the middle. Love the phone though.
UgyetH1ed1ewaXX-zoN4AaABAg,"If it aint broken, dont fix it."
Ugx8kRFDRCUgotG5wBl4AaABAg,How much did they pay you to review
UgxR0zBdkkHDhyDDTq14AaABAg,Is it half price this is old technology
Ugywrg-80qYbj_QuJOF4AaABAg,I‚Äôll be waiting for the Galaxy tab s9 series review ‚ò∫Ô∏è
UgyEb5pXAEQ27ndEa5t4AaABAg,"Of course they settled. They didn&#39;t need to change much besides the aspect ratio, battery, and the hinge. <br><br>1 of 3 in a 1-2 year product turnover isn&#39;t bad"
UgxRzJGS5c1KD5OSKJh4AaABAg,"Wouldnt mind seeing a review of the galaxy watch and the tablet as well. I really like that they bought back the physical rotating bezel on the watch, always thought that was a nice feature."
UgxovIhER5kTDG5nyZZ4AaABAg,The flip is fine but the fold outside screen could use a size bump.
UgwuGOPvFs54Z_7OzhR4AaABAg,Looks like Samsung is waiting for Apple to make a move. Samsung is great at playing the catch up game but not in leading the game.
UgxBPlCEbWq12DvVst54AaABAg,"I know that there&#39;s a lot more tech that goes into sensors these days, but I&#39;m struggling to understand why Samsung thinks the target consumers for folding phones would pay through the nose for the (fairly) novel feature and be ok with downgrading to a 12MP. These phones scream status symbol to me, and the first thing people will ask an owner after marveling at the crease is &quot;I bet the camera is great, can you show me a picture?&quot;. Battery makes sense. Software enhancements also help, as we&#39;ve seen with the Pixel in years&#39; past. But, like the Pixel, it is still a glaring hole in the spec sheet, even more than a battery or screen brightness. Tech heads love the display speeds, but I&#39;m betting half (or more) of the market doesn&#39;t even know what that means, much less notice the difference without reference."
UgyN6_JVbpzrmoC0Fh14AaABAg,"As much as I love my fold 4, I was really hoping this would have been a wider display on the cover, the aspect ratio is just too tall and thin"
UgxZgXkrOXYgnIab0gR4AaABAg,"Goes to show you why we do not need new products every year. All these new models of consumer goods every year is not needed. It&#39;s a waste. On top of that these companies make many models or sizes of the same products. At this point with phone so powerful we really do not need 10 new phones coming out every year. That goes to computers cars etc etc. If it&#39;s going to be the same design with very little upgrade then it&#39;s unnecessary and a waste. Let&#39;s Stop over producing stuff and Consuming stuff. That&#39;s 1 reason why we&#39;re so miserable too. We need to simplify life, decluter. Get rid of all these unnecessary things. Anyways I have the fold 3 for 1 yr now, and won&#39;t change until maybe 2 or 3 more yrs. Might finally move to apple. Idk we&#39;ll see."
UgxZP6toCXafv7S6WKd4AaABAg,"I had the galaxy mega right when it came out. Man, playing asphalt on such a big screen was AMAZINNG. I got a free galaxy tab 3 with the deal through at&amp;t and I felt stupid for even having it because it wasn&#39;t much bigger than my phone. Not to mention, I got the experimental mega- which had more ram than the standard one."
UgwOjRBdSTm0qD4CJoN4AaABAg,"I have had every fold since the first one came out, my fold 4 doesn&#39;t open fully anymore, I pulled one of the felt brushes out of the hinge as it ended up sticking out, it is by far the worst one I have had so I will need to upgrade to the Fold 5, hopefully the new hinge will be a lot more durable and not break due to less moving parts, fingers crossed anyway. I could never go back to a normal phone, the Fold is amazing however Samsung need to make it wider so the front screen is like a regular smart phone, come on surely they can manage it and it will make room for the S Pen to be stored in the phone, the size of the Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 would be nice."
UgzKJ7oQql8A3SZGpAR4AaABAg,Who‚Äôs actually buying these? Never seen one in public
UgzTU10cuySgUctKo5Z4AaABAg,"When the crease goes, then I&#39;ll think about even thinking about buying one."
Ugyy5N-_VGZlc6ZuAvd4AaABAg,"Tried the flip, really didn‚Äôt like the grove.  Personally not something I would spend hard earned cash on."
UgyQGmzk1KJlh7qSkJZ4AaABAg,They need to stop slacking on the Z Flip&#39;s cameras. I have the Z flip 4 and  it was literally a downgrade from my S10 because i lost the telephoto lens üòê
UgzlD4oitN-8cVF_0jB4AaABAg,"Eh, crease kills it for me. Just can&#39;t do it. I would love a dual display version of the Fold v.s. a bendable display ..."
Ugwz7KRcsDGzqYx0oOJ4AaABAg,"This is the upgrade year, not the innovation year."
UgzLehkXyZ8ya7kHCXx4AaABAg,i hate how they moved the flashlight out of the camera module. its such a useless change and it actively looks worse.
UgzL1bFvsXXZd3W5zwl4AaABAg,You should talk about why Samsung isn&#39;t making Galaxy Tags anymore!!
UgwK-9MGOf3fqrabC0l4AaABAg,sleeper üí§  event. Where is the innovation.
UgySNV9S2zIjVgOwKhl4AaABAg,I still vastly prefer the S23 Ultra over their foldables but I might buy a foldable in the future just to have one because it does like nice.
Ugw0wcPv2PHWaNcO_t54AaABAg,"I can definitely say I saw this flips/folds being a thing a while ago they basically have  been copying plot or line  Apple they basically figured out a way to sell you less capable tech for more money I‚Äôm using an iPhone 13 to saying this, so I‚Äôm not just hating I‚Äôm just saying I definitely saw Samsung preparing for the same it‚Äôs not necessarily bad idea either because they are selling you OS on top of that great optimization performance in general there are   kinks there hitting, misses, but they basically just figured out an apple plot line and for it being a flip/fold phone I saw Samsung  creeping on it"
UgzZrpSoupTfvoJPy1t4AaABAg,We all saw the easter egg right? MKBDH is going to release his own wallpapers app :)
UgzFc1Bjd4DPrB-zjid4AaABAg,Samsung is so ridiculous
Ugy6IJr-djORMbF0rOV4AaABAg,I still don&#39;t get the Flip. It&#39;s just a gimmik and provides no real benefit over a regular smartphone.
Ugyh7L0Kgx_T_yFoTGp4AaABAg,"I guess samsung should accept now and may be start announcing too. That foldable phone is Flip series, and foldable tablet is Fold series. I stopped using Samsung, since price is hiking and camera and processing not top notch. Using Oppo Find N2, best foldable placement till now i would say, very compact yet powerful, unfolded the size is similar to Iphone 13mini."
Ugwz_eG8zR57BnFNcrJ4AaABAg,"Not gonna lie, definitely cool but like man, I‚Äôll be damned I pull out a phone and flip it open again this is goofy"
Ugy2yy_A3jFeKZ_iw-p4AaABAg,"Still have my fold 3 with me but unfortunately, inside screen is totally damaged, 70% of it is blank. It started with the s.protector in the middle detaching then about a month or so, a tiny cracked line appeared. Took off the whole s.protector with care but it even made it worse. Did not bother to take it to samsung service first time the black line appeared cause it&#39;s no longer under the 1year free samsung cares policy. And seeing the new fold 5, i&#39;d rather wait for one that has a really reliable inside screen."
UgytmJVsI0waVS_G2yt4AaABAg,"is it just me that noticed a wobble on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=3m18s"">3:18</a> (timestamp) part after so long on MKBHD&#39;s videos?"
UgxzI2gGtiNt3BfnUdd4AaABAg,The form factor is one of the best to my opinion. It slides much more easily in my pocket than a passport like phone.
UgzIUOe3cO05a_AWZnZ4AaABAg,Nay ! Not gonna buy Fold5! Almost 2K yet cameras ain‚Äôt good enough
UgxoJJ05g0NDmsF2Y-V4AaABAg,Its display gets damaged within a year<br>Its not a reliable product
UgybsBM6C-dq3NivqnF4AaABAg,Low-key glad it&#39;s like this cause I have the 4 and it felt like it hasn&#39;t been that long.
UgzKH8F2cq2KoTdCm4t4AaABAg,Flip is MOTOROLA for me
UgxdDkIIK_OGPh5UpAJ4AaABAg,Your last comment in the video is what disappoints me the most. $1800 for a very incremental upgrade.
UgzXEVO95Zib1qZz5-94AaABAg,The way you undersold the biggest feature Samsung watch fans are excited for kind of baffled me. The rotating bezel was completely missing from the Watch 5 line which caused a notable dip in sales for that generation. Hence why they brought it back after just a year.
UgzqfrgemaX8K8uHikN4AaABAg,"Had the Samsung flip 3, liked it at first, but the battery wasn‚Äôt great and the software didn‚Äôt help at all. Was at a gig and only had 9% and for some reason my phone decided to maximised the brightness, which used up the remaining battery life It had left. This was on battery saving mode as well, so frustrating. So switched back to iPhone, super happy being back."
UgyQljflR_Iw2r9NjDB4AaABAg,Who&#39;s laughing now about releasing same phone every year
UgzqE_zseL_vuwj-pg94AaABAg,Apple is going to out design them with their flip phone. Watch and see one more year. Is going to be perfection to the Max
UgyEUKOec-vTd6kpwL94AaABAg,Flip is so cute. Love it
UgxIucVKDVAqG8nlHyZ4AaABAg,"I&#39;m actually a big Samsung fan, but boy they got lazy with these 2 phones"
Ugxn_-B2XyxOQTePvo94AaABAg,"So what I&#39;m hearing is: 1, Samsung did not innovate, don&#39;t drop your Fold 4 for the Fold 5, it&#39;s pointless. 2, Apple, please hurry and come up with a foldable phone so Samsung can innovate anew because seemingly, they are sitting on they asses cause they pretty much own the foldable market."
UgyJkvvqu5Zi4jlYg454AaABAg,"Fold 5 looks amazing üëè. Good job Samsung, but didnt make me convince to trade in my Fold 2. Gonna have to wait next year to see Fold 6."
UgxFczRSSNFwfvUTYvZ4AaABAg,Thank you Marques! Love the vids : )
Ugyyp1NSjCB4BKz8Gdd4AaABAg,The cameras being the same is nonsensical.
UgzXuWj1cq05S8nqTqJ4AaABAg,"Hi Marcus. Thanks for the super honest opinion on the new phones! I was looking for that because I was considering buying the Fold. Could you also please make a video about any advice on the Samsung Care+ policy? Given the history of Samsung&#39;s refusal to fix obvious damages, this advice would go a long way in educating potential customers."
UgwjuvMlVYSfv8DewLB4AaABAg,"I&#39;ve owned the fold 3 and fold 4 and regardless of how much they improve the hinge and add a reused, older CPU. The form factor is just not enough for most people.<br><br>The only reason people buy them is because they were &quot;first&quot; but seeing all the new folds coming out, Samsung definitely cannot keep getting away with subpar innovation in the folding space. <br><br>The Honor Magic looks amazing and it&#39;s such a shame it&#39;s only released in china.<br><br>I will not be buying the fold 5 but I might get that S9 Ultra, god damn üòç"
Ugy6plxK7tdqMXCn9R14AaABAg,I&#39;m disappointed. <br>I love my flip but I&#39;m tired of the potato camera.

Ugx9cQkZxYh9LZxdTVN4AaABAg,My question is why would you ever need to own a tablet if you have a fold? It‚Äôs literally both
Ugz5RpSN9gWxHwKKtcN4AaABAg,but can you slam it shut and it would hang up the call. I miss that with clam phones. Where you can slam the phone shut to end the call and lets the other user really know you are done talking to them.

UgwL8cw3-jq8rniRy9J4AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=3m15s"">3:15</a> it also has DeX and I bet it supports lousy FHD and that&#39;s it."
UgxIQrqC4ZMkSvzjp054AaABAg,And where is the videos about the watches and tablets?? You guys always do this if this was apple you would do 10 minutes video for an iPhone for just having one color!!! You should watch Dave and learn something or 2 from him that was a detailed first look in less time than your video
UgzrhiOs9S46nTd9GAF4AaABAg,I like the form factor of the Flip phones but I just wish they didn&#39;t go with this tall and narrow shape. I want a galaxy S+ phone that folds in half.
UgwII5_eB9tkVQhoyZl4AaABAg,"A bit like the s23 series launch. Shockingly similar at first, but the true upgrades slowly show up"
UgwN6-YZF3ycbv-zmZx4AaABAg,What happened to the pledge you made about always having a sustainability/repairability section in phone review videos in your Fairphone 4 review video?
Ugwo0GCioVFtZjfwHvl4AaABAg,Very nice video
UgzQDM1Iw8dCfNOKTOF4AaABAg,Samsung is the God of smartphones ‚ù§üòÇ
Ugzv_BPkYtB2bu0xZtV4AaABAg,"This size of outside screen is way better than the pixel and oppo bcz why should I care if there is a narrow screen, I&#39;m buying this phone to open it and use the big screen inside not small one like the pixel and oppo, if you want to use the cover screen way more than the inside then just stick with your slab phone that&#39;s the whole point"
Ugy-ccuiOsHkX44HxVV4AaABAg,"My phone is not foldable but I tried to fold and you know what, unfortunately it broked."

Ugzut4JY-O1sJIgDx4d4AaABAg,Kinda curious about the new tablet
UgwwagxA-pIXh6HbTjd4AaABAg,"My financial conditions are too far for me to be able to afford one, but I&#39;m curious about the tech and these are two pieces of news that I&#39;ve been waiting for about foldables:<br> - When are they going to mature and settle? (this has been answered today)<br> - What is it like 10 years of using down the line? (yes, I do use my own phone, a cheap one, for that long if I can)"
Ugz2juhMJHoDiHf6C7R4AaABAg,I thought one plus was the one who never settles
UgzvCvW-98f0MBWzZpJ4AaABAg,Too little for that price tag and the tier. Especially not upgrading the camera in a flagship over its predecessor is ridiculous. I have to bring in my phone for a repair and if they even try to suggest to me that I might want to upgrade rather than keep my phone I&#39;m going to have to chuckle. What for? Just a new chipset?
UgxykKpObfm9rBzX3nt4AaABAg,is there any chance of folding gaming tab
Ugwp_-nFXAab2DrY4c14AaABAg,"Man, it seems expectations are getting a little weird. Surely, it won&#39;t be long, someone is going to whine that the Google Fold is too wide to use with one hand when folded. Someone else will cry that the S Pen is too narrow to hold comfortably. It never ends. It&#39;s almost as absurd as being disappointed in the fact that a ball is a sphere.  Why can&#39;t they just make a ball a different shape?? Dang me."
UgyhHUhdzO879vq51h14AaABAg,"Fold Original was the best form-factor, and why i went FOld immediately. Small outside screen?YES!; the small screen made dialing one-handed easier compared to iPhone, etc.  You&#39;re not supposed to use the out screen for other than dialing and notifications, IMHO.  The narrow (when closed) body also feels better one-handed.  Trying to do anything more on the outer screen is not wise, i don&#39;t even understand why people wanted the outer screen bigger in the first place?<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>  Lastly, bring back the stainless steel, it was SO posh (for the price).

Ugz4srmJatASHlakmLZ4AaABAg,Still feels like a downgrade from my S23 Ultra.  Wife seems to want the Flip though due to the BTS members having one.  (So there&#39;s that)
UgzX7-ylPOxqS-4j2TR4AaABAg,I kinda liked the look of Z Flip 4 more than the Flip 5. <br><br>The two-way color tones were cool and the smaller displayseemed perfect for trying to use your phone less and mindlessly going to Instagram or whatever. You could just check your stuff and not have this big vibrant display inviting you to use your phone more

Ugz8lkF55gvFBAPLf4V4AaABAg,"Honestly i think if samsung is trying to refine their software at this time [while being stagnant for 2-3 yrs (for samsung) ] and app designers see that and design apps for samsung phones/tablets think they are going to be at the top the only thing holding samsung back is software if they refine their camera software better, their eco system which has gotten more smoother a little bit better, also work on the single core and multi core to make that better (most likely have to build a cpu from scratch for that) bc they have the hardware just need software"

Ugw58PriwurABuAi-tl4AaABAg,We‚Äôve reached that point where there isn‚Äôt much to improve year over year. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to start seeing 18mo release cycles vs yearly
UgwK7t7LTLWYlV8tLhV4AaABAg,"Well I was waiting to see if they would get rid of that skinny ass screen. Looks like they failed me. Looks like the Google fold is the top dog. The second I can go into a store and buy it, I&#39;m no longer a galaxy user."
UgwuUu80XM0CcvWoBHx4AaABAg,"they saw that the $1800 was palatable enough to drive some decent sales, driven by aggressive trade-in values.   So yeah, I don&#39;t think they want to lower that price any time soon. It&#39;s the bar they&#39;ve set."
UgxQq_DEl2h1xGvusdh4AaABAg,i feel like one day they‚Äôll get rid of the crease. i don‚Äôt know how but i feel like it will come. maybe a more flexible screen. who knows. when it comes it‚Äôll be perfect

Ugx6Ebs0wVO8Yo2o7hl4AaABAg,"I&#39;m so damn excited. I almost bought a Z Fold 4 about 7 months ago because my S10 5G is starting to show it&#39;s age but didn&#39;t wanna upgrade until the Fold 5 came out since it was just over 6 months away. I&#39;ve gone with Samsung phones since my S5 so I&#39;m probably gonna stick with them but I am curious in the other foldables on the market. After holding the Fold 4 though, I really enjoy the skinnier shape of the front screen so I think I&#39;ve pretty much already made my mind up lol"

UgyncywI8_ZtM5OwUZ54AaABAg,"Unlike the iPhone that changes the color, and everyone goes crazy.  I&#39;m just waiting for the iPhone to come out with a flip phone and claim they are innovating."
UgzgSlCKUGrlfhP61oV4AaABAg,I regretted buying my fold4 like a month later I was extremely let down with the camera set up and craaaap quality of photos I compared it to my note 9 and it was only slightly better. I&#39;ll be dropping the folders till they can either drop prices drastically or give me the s23 ultra camera set up and quaily I&#39;ll take the 22 or 21 ultras cameras for 1900 dollars for the fold4. The big screen was cool for a bit but still wasn&#39;t even that crispy or sharp I wish I would have went with the 23ultra im dropping this phone soon and going back to the s line asap. And it&#39;s even more disappointing to hear that the the fold 5 is identical in specs upsets me that I bought into the fold with hopes that next generation would be leaps ahead or that I&#39;d at least get a camera setup worthy of the 1800 dollar price tag.

UgwVna1Qc5CaYT8X1w54AaABAg,Samsung is behind...Motorolla&#39;s flip phone and several folding phones from China blow theirs out of the water.
UgxUw0JJLkQk3rl3W4l4AaABAg,"Its not about being safe.... its really about being lazy and the lack of competition. The reason why they did not make any changes is because they do not have that much competition. Okay ill say it,,, Apple does not have a foldable phone. So they h=do not feel any competition other than from Apple. Also, they lack ideas of their own. Once Apple will release a foldable phone... you will see more developments from Samsung. Then Apple will come out with cool feature for their foldable phone and Samsung will just copy it. That is really how it is.... when you have no competitor, these company will not need to provide people with too many features which will increase their cost."
Ugw0CBJ9jpNMvj-Y3nR4AaABAg,"I guess I&#39;ll be holding onto my Note 10 Lite a little longer.  I really want a Fold but I NEED the stylus to go into the phone like a Note.  I don&#39;t want anything sticking out and I really enjoy all the advantages the S-pen brings.  I&#39;m begrudgingly giving up on a headphone jack, but I refuse to buy anything where the recommended stylus doesn&#39;t fit into the phone.  My Nokia 5800 back in the day spoiled me forever.  That phone was ahead of its time.  I legit used it from ~2010 to 2016 (with an unfortunate foray into iPhones for part of that).  I want to stick with Samsung, but I do not support companies charging more for less.  ~$2000 for a phone?  My Note 10 Lite has a headphone jack, microSD card (that is invaluable when you need to take the SD card out of your car&#39;s dashcam to replay something when you&#39;re not at home), AND an S-pen that fits inside the device and I got it brand new for less than $600."
UgyNT5XAgxCjiNhPvQV4AaABAg,Solid content as always
UgxRkwhyX7T9A2Yr0AF4AaABAg,"Although I own the S23U n loving every bit of it, but was jus wondering why Samsung, with all of their billions of worth, can&#39;t get rid of the crease on their folds like how a smaller company like OPPO can achieve?"
UgyMUAJo7RVvIxbWTfl4AaABAg,The hinge is a MAJOR update to me
Ugze0EwXRLRbJ97TQ254AaABAg,After having all the Folds(1 through 4)... I couldn&#39;t take Samsung not making the dimensions any wider. My Google Pixel fold is now my new daily driver. I&#39;ll miss you Samsung. Maybe next year.
UgyjrySTS5zS_vVkLVV4AaABAg,"Soo...can the coverscreen of the new ZFlip be used for anything other than the dumb widgets? One reason I&#39;m thinking of switching to the Razr is because you can use basically the whole phone without opening it. Without that functionality, making the screen bigger is pointless."
UgwUWBCJbtEOuQNxLgJ4AaABAg,"accept the old large galaxy phones had 16x9 screens, which is far and away better than these stupid arbitrary ridiculous tall and skinny phones. LG was smart when they made the G6 with a 18:9 (2:1) screen. and they had camera and software features that made sense. then samsung ruined everything."
UgxZTnajTINGXyTUXaB4AaABAg,As a Z flip owner that&#39;s all the change we wanted.
Ugx7BWi4BtyEbiykoxh4AaABAg,"All I want is a Fold with as less bloatware as possible, 120HZ VRR Screen, larger battery, actual flagship cameras and without a crease. Gotta wait a few more years I guess. Rocking my old phone for 6 years now since I&#39;ve been saying &quot;I will probably get next gen&#39;s foldable&quot; for 3 years now"
UgziAdydu9g75LPcdxd4AaABAg,We all know samsung we‚Äôll just wait for apple‚Äôs foldable and make improvement only based on apple‚Äôs. We saw this in almost every new category that they entered like smart watch and tablet.

UgxmrZAd7OyDoK9Ceu94AaABAg,"To me Samsung settled long ago, since the Note 10 or 20 if I remember correctly, it was barely different from the year before. Same for S21 or S22, about the same.¬†<br><br>The only phones they focused on was Ultras, and it was also mainly main cameras and spen inside and outside, also spen minor updates, bigger battery and exynos to qualcomm, then 8gen2 made everything much better, no more game optimization throttling, better endurance, less heat soaked.

UgyXdFX2V1UGDSRAe0B4AaABAg,"The Z Flip/Fold series looks so alluring... until you get one. Within the first month or two, the &quot;screen protector&quot; has debris in it. In 6 months, it ages as much as a regular phone will in 2 years. And if you ever drop it, the hinge dies, unable to fully unfold or keep the 2 halves aligned. And the best part? It won&#39;t be covered in the manufacturer warranty! <br>In short: appreciate this design and technological marvel... but from a distance.<br>Source: a sad Z Flip 4 owner"

Ugzk1TGj13ZzvOKZ-EB4AaABAg,"My Pixel 6 is great but I just can&#39;t use it with one hand. The &quot;regular&quot; phone size nowadays always feel like oversized in my opinion. In that way, the size of this phone looks a great proposition: It is thin and practical when folded, for quick and easy use, while providing an &quot;expert&quot; larger option. Makes sense to me and I&#39;m looking forward to try it. It is like having a small 2 seat for commuting, and a sedan for travelling."

I get that it&#39;s just plastic film, but I&#39;d still like it to not do this again. Which I suspect is impossible hence why Apple still doesn&#39;t have a foldable (maybe they do, but it&#39;s locked up in a basement somewhere until they can figure out how to protect the folding screen)<br><br>Other than that, this is the best phone I&#39;ve ever owned.

UgzxHXY1QOFCOtwcN7R4AaABAg,"One feature the cover screen really needs is the ability to unlock the phone.

UgzAvQNQBmpqGjOoLJB4AaABAg,"Fold 5 = Most EMBARRASSING phone ever released for $1800. WOW! It&#39;s unbelievable how the Honor Magic V2 is now TWO full generations better in design than Samsung.  No stylus support on the cover screen (unlike the V2). God awfully slow 25W charging (Vivo X Fold 2 charges at 120W and includes the charger in the box!).  Terrible narrow aspect ratio on cover screen. The same pathetic deep gap/crease as 3 years ago (which other companies have long since fixed). Still much much heavier than the best competition that exists (V2 weighs even less than an S23 Ultra).  As thick as a brick compared to several Chinese foldables yet suffers from much-much-smaller battery syndrome.  Same camera from last year (which was already an inferior disappointment even 12 months ago).  Poorly designed sharp bottom-left corner that digs into the palm (again, unlike the superior competition). No decrease in price (any surprise the Honor V2 is selling like crazy now in China?).  The Fold is not popular like the Flip for a reason - it&#39;s a terrible design!  Who is going to buy this device at $2000 w tax and then be stuck with it (its slow 25W charging etc) for several years before their next phone purchase? Seriously who? The upcoming OnePlus Open and eventual global release of the V2 could not come sooner.  üéâ Their arrival is badly needed as Samsung has just output its most expensive yet laziest design on record.  So the next 10 months will be Samsung&#39;s most embarrassing ever.  No doubt."

UgwkQfWcYZCfFnMDKuh4AaABAg,$1000 for the flip? Talk about targeting the wrong audience lol. Boomers would be eating that thing up but not for a grand.
UgwjxIpaVpQiwPj6G3B4AaABAg,I was so excited for the flip but it just isn&#39;t enough for the pricing. I hope the Pixel 8 Pro is promising. I have been using the same phone for the last 4 years so I&#39;m looking forward to a new phone. So far nothing has gotten me excited to invest.
UgzoKhwrw5E7ahRUsLd4AaABAg,I had the fold 3.  The skinny front display has for to go.  It&#39;s impossible to type with it.  Making the front display good only for reading notifications.  It was too skinny for reading web pages or articles.  And navigation was awful.  But open the fold and it changes to a great mini tablet.

UgxIZdn2ZwUA9RgwupV4AaABAg,"Wait, what happened to ‚ÄúMKBHD Here‚Äù in the intro?"
UgzGoPZpltpzCV8tDAR4AaABAg,at least they slightly fixed the one issue with the fold 3 and 4 that annoys me the most is the location of the flash. on the 4 and the 3 its under the camaras making useing the flashlight function difficult in tight places or looking under things

UgytSfHUFDeqzjEzl414AaABAg,That intro reminds me of kofuzi

UgxQA0vxYvVycY9e7sd4AaABAg,I have my old old fold 3 and as far as I can see there is no reason to upgrate it. I&#39;ll wait until they integrate the stylus and update the cameras at least to the current &quot;ultra&quot; level. P.S. I want s tab 9 ultra.

Ugz2HJg_gIvcdhmWoXd4AaABAg,"If you focus on the camera, the foldable smartphone cannot secure the thickness of the camera part, so it is optically disadvantageous and has only disadvantages.

UgzEog9LVeDtG7f1izl4AaABAg,Here&#39;s hoping they fixed the various hinge issues on those 4th gen foldables. I was considering a fold 4 since 5 ain&#39;t much of an upgrade but sounds like those issues plagued that last gen. Looks I&#39;ll just be replacing the battery on my aged fold 3 and hope I can get a sweet deal later if they hold up.
Ugyde4BIw9aUeiwZm-B4AaABAg,they&#39;ve hit a threshold.
UgzQvPAT1K6pbWVmVM94AaABAg,whats up with the; hating everything that is not 30fps? please explain :)
Ugx1dHW4wkG2c2l183J4AaABAg,Approximately 60% of countries don&#39;t know what is apple pay or Google pay is. Just for example<br>Here they see in Domminican repoplic you  try to pay with apple pay the don&#39;t understand what is it. You explain them again and again and again it is apple pay!!!!! The smartphone support visa or and Mastercard payment system. They just don&#39;t want to understand. God. It is so frustrating!!!
Ugx8MIbETkINUQz7S_R4AaABAg,I wanna see a sliding phone or a side kick flip style like that lg phone from a few years ago
UgzisNPZT8b9ndNw5WF4AaABAg,Out raging the price the want!!!
Ugzk2AYrYyt2dhaIZuJ4AaABAg,I guess I will be sticking to my Fold 3 again this year. I want way better cameras and wider outside display. üò¢
UgwhUJI_gbRw4yL4aIx4AaABAg,This is very expensive. For nothing!!!!
UgxUqcTpMIhidnMbmd54AaABAg,You say the camera is the same but the camera on the google pixel was the same for like 4 years yet they improved the photos with software. Is that the case here?
Ugx8P5Sm_h2R3ItTd7x4AaABAg,1200 usd for a new iphone!<br>This is very very very expensive!!!!
Ugz9HZKH8polCc5pSSB4AaABAg,I got zfold 3 been impressed on how much of a tank this has been. I been rocking it naked for almost 2 years. Countless 5ft drops been in fresh and salt water still no broken glamss everything still works. Now get this a few weeks ago I dropped it quite good and the screens wouldn&#39;t turn on (even thought i could tell the phone was on). Looked it up on the internet and people told me to just open it and punch the screens real hard a couple of times..... It worked!!!üòÇüòÇüòÇ I went to town on the phone cause i really didnt care if it broke but darn the screen politely turned on and now everything is fine. So say what you want about zfolds but Samsung did an amazing job on these!
UgxJwJkqE2gTRT-bGjx4AaABAg,In australia .. the price for fold 5 is almost 3K....
UgwyJ4k5D7omI3PBUeh4AaABAg,Yeah lets copy apple making minimal updates every year to our devices (says samsung) ü§£ only apple can get away still making sales with minimal updates. Samsung really thinks they can compete with apple based on this mentality. NEVER
Ugz_S_ciGjqadewVY_l4AaABAg,"Wow, a $1k phone w/ 256GB SSD in 2023 gets a thumbs up I guess. But currently, you can buy Intel 670p 2TB NVME for $70 or lesser = THUMB down all the way."

Ugw4zSBamPgz5IOaX2R4AaABAg,Had iPhones for a while then with the price of the iPhone X i thought thats ridiculous i go to Android and got myself a galaxy s9 and a while later a s20 and didnt regret that at the time but then samsung&#39;s prices were pretty much the same and i kind of liked the new look of the iphone 13 pro so i went back to apple and i was SO HAPPY. i didnt realize it when going from apple to samsung but when i came back i realized how much smoother and better iOS feels compared to android. im happy that i made the switch to android in the past because now i can actually judge both sides and i can not imagine ever going back to android especially since apple has a lot of the features that i always missed back in the days like an actual file explorer for example and samsung starts to remove everything that made them better before like having a slot for an sd card or removable batteries

Ugzl6OGvF7XH5R4Al9d4AaABAg,I don&#39;t get it. This is nearly every phone ever. Mostly the same with a few minor improvements.
UgwdeuoaMQiEYZlQjDN4AaABAg,"I won&#39;t consider the Z Fold until it has the ultra&#39;s camera and battery. Not willing to give that up, but I guess there is always next year!"
Ugx0_EfzyNRBqDGFygd4AaABAg,Definitely sticking to my Fold4. I&#39;ll wait for next gen
UgxdMfka9pi7jNMFc9d4AaABAg,"New hinge is important. I loved my Zflip 3 but the redesigned hinge on the 4 is garbage. I abused the heck out of my flip 3 and it was fine, but a coffee-table drop onto hardwood broke the hinge of my flip 4 twice."
UgzvktFcWSNyzzKCIGJ4AaABAg,"I got the Flip5 for $50, so I can&#39;t complain!"
UgywLrzOkWtv3gCDveh4AaABAg,Let just say Samsung just taking a chapter out of Apple playbook. Why put everything in these foldable phones now then by doing so. Nobody would see any reason to upgrade. I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre be checking on how Google new wider shorter foldable phone sells. Then they probably will go in that direction because frankly there nothing. That I see that would make me trade my Galaxy s22 for the Z Fold 5. Personally if Xfinity mobile was selling the Google Pixel fold I would trade up in a minute.
UgymOgw9t5uh9PiKFph4AaABAg,I feel I should stay with my ultra 23 I do love how the folds look
UgyhKg60AzUO6cv2O0h4AaABAg,"The entire reason i used the Fold3, Fold4 and will be getting the Fold5 is because of the candybar design of the front screen! hard to find a flagship phone that can fit tiny hands"
Ugz6f_FrbYjR7-BPyCp4AaABAg,"I don&#39;t know how to feel about the phone industry anymore, I&#39;ve been holding on to my note 9 hoping for something interesting to happen in the industry but i get the feeling that moment isn&#39;t coming"
Ugx2E7i7jzbIcwCeu114AaABAg,I have a flip 4 and cant wait to upgrade to the zflip5. That gap when folded was a pain but love this phone
UgyTZWCARJPYvAGONCx4AaABAg,Oppo has the best hardware and Samsung has the best software
UgzJBaQiqoh_eAAuDcJ4AaABAg,Impressiveüëç
UgzfsPljo46sD_Vjs9Z4AaABAg,moto‚Äôs razr+ actually looks and feels better than the flip 5 . we got the demos in our store and side by side .. I‚Äôd go moto
UgzT9qxnyT0lRzmrVAJ4AaABAg,"Am I the only one that hates the outer screen design on the flip? Personally, I would rather have a 3rd camera for telephoto than that tiny bit of extra screen"
UgyM5W1BvUZsUdBFEml4AaABAg,What a letdown. I guess I&#39;m saving my money on the Z fold 5.
UgwkqOEeSW7asX4zpcN4AaABAg,"I&#39;m glad they kep the narrow cover screen. For me the narrow screen is perfect for one handed use. Swyping for the keyboard and scrolling simple text content. If I need to use 2 hands or browsing any other content I&#39;m opening the fold anyways.<br><br>And even more importantly I think the final aspect ratio for the open fold is way more functional than the pixel both for watching content and multitasking.  For content especially, both phones will end up with black bars but the pixel wastes the majority of the screen."
UgxB7UHzigS5EKj1MPJ4AaABAg,Few things say &#39;murican like zeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
UgzyCnZds9_GSEhfjt54AaABAg,"Fold 3 user here. So, on one hand I actually really like Samsung&#39;s form factor, and I hope it stays the same or similar to how it is now. But on the other hand, I want exactly what you said: bigger battery, S-Pen slot, better cameras, just SOMETHING. I mean, the 4 isn&#39;t much different from the 3 I have, and the 4 is barely different from the 5, so basically I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s worth upgrading to the 5 from the 3."
UgxATIaJI2xCMKCHEJR4AaABAg,You need to try the Vivo Xfold 2 or a Honor Magic V2 or a Huawei Mate X3.
UgyqHGnJxQmMiMRpjrx4AaABAg,Well it‚Äôs just the same review üòÇüòÇ
UgxZcKa4gW1PNjlmBC14AaABAg,Boring!
Ugz2AFdduhvjpZkSbDp4AaABAg,"So I bought the pixel fold. I really like it, but Samsung decided to give amazing trade deals. So I pre-ordered it, just in case it is better than the pixel.  So we will see how good the chip set is. If it blows my mind I&#39;ll keep it. If it is just ok. Then the pixel stays."

UgzXJTd-P8sU_QjIt7N4AaABAg,"I‚Äôm wondering if maybe they just put all their budget into refining the folding part itself, and also guessing that maybe it‚Äôs still in the phase of seeing if people will actually buy this in good enough numbers, to determine if they should pivot or keep going"
UgxbjgMbhY6W4_ubo6t4AaABAg,I actually like the size of the fold as is. It‚Äôs easier to manage with one hand and easier to read long messages on.
Ugz-VkrO2xcUkMA69Fd4AaABAg,Microsoft Duo did it first and better.
UgzLCpi4cPecj6nS9Ml4AaABAg,Apple equals the king of settling in. Same design and product how many years straight?  Even though iPhones have become boring they still outsell all other phones. So maybe Samsung is on to something.

UgysC453CclfRKvi-dx4AaABAg,We‚Äôre at a point of phone innovation once again where we resolve to gimmicks rather than actual innovation. Really ripe for disruption.
Ugy1CnK0oCw_ZEQ0zTR4AaABAg,"It&#39;s been a while since you&#39;ve showcased a budget smartphone, could you do a video on the state of budget smartphones currently, because the other half of your mantra, &quot;cheap phones are getting good&quot;, is slowly perishing as even budget phones are getting more expensive."
UgzbQIFQC15lKS5z5lN4AaABAg,"My best advice is don&#39;t buy the fold 5. Or flip. If you are a heavy gamer... This piece of garbage will not last 12 months, if u r lucky.. Mine died at 6 months. Fixed n died another 12 months later... Cos I played another game that causes it to heat up. The WiFi will stop functioning as the first hint, follow by not being able to hot-spot. Then ending with the black screen of death. Only the outer screen works. So don&#39;t bother buying, if u play games. Really fragile, heat weak mobile. Disappointing, n cheated by Samsung. So... Beware guys n gals. üò¢"

UgwkDtEF2Nkvut_8But4AaABAg,"I&#39;ve had a fold4 since day one and I just pre-ordered a flip5. The fold is awesome and amazing for content consumption and multi tasking, but the compromises you have to make to carry a tablet sized foldable are just not worth it for me as of now. Still a huge fan though! Cant wait to see how foldables evolve. :)"
UgwRI60nDaE4zg_sxYV4AaABAg,look Flip phone&#39;s are cool but for some reason if someone were to purchase this phone the Person would be CONSTANTLY keep looking at the phone looking for defaults like creases and would not actually enjoy the phone But only to be worring about the defects..PASS

UgxOexy3rAAmWDDhJTx4AaABAg,they need to come out with a cheaper folding phone
UgwPGRMOtC1HOXwPOfh4AaABAg,"Everyone&#39;s going to have their own needs. Most people I know love the S23 / iPhone14 form factor, so the Flip is perfect for them. And they all have a separate tablet. So seriously if that&#39;s what works, go with it and get an S23 or an iPhone. It&#39;s still a great option.<br>What never gets mentioned about that tall, narrow screen is: I&#39;m clumsy. I drop everything. But that tall, skinny form factor I&#39;ve never dropped (Fold 1, 3.5 yrs of daily use). It sits so much better in your hand. That, for me, is THE use case for a Fold. Mobile optimised on the front, everything else you&#39;re using the internal screen (inc heavy use of desktop only web apps)."
Ugx0MuamX3Wb2oyUanJ4AaABAg,"Actually yes I did know that was the z fold 4.  Look where the flash is.<br>Also, every iPhone looks the same too.  Just because you put different lens housings in the back doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a different design dude.  I thought you were supposed to be an expert...."

UgzNZcu4U0amrS9ROxt4AaABAg,"Really, really disappointed in Samsung. Android is supposed to push the envelope and try new things, not settle for miniscule incremental updates. That&#39;s Apple&#39;s job<br><br>I&#39;ve been saying this for a few years now; if I am going to spend nearly twice as much on a phone, I don&#39;t want to make ANY sacrifices. That means the best cameras, best battery, best screen, best features, and at least standard durability. However, that&#39;s not the case with the Galaxy Fold. It has the cameras of a mid-tier phone, the durability of a budget phone, pretty average battery life, less functionality than the S series because it doesn&#39;t come with an S pen inside, and a strange form factor that isn&#39;t quite usable closed and is awkward while open (almost all videos and apps have big black bars on the sides because the aspect ratio isn&#39;t standard)<br><br>I love the idea of foldables but, unless they make it worth every penny of $1800, I&#39;m going to stick with my normal &quot;chocolate bar&quot; phone"
Ugx7OwOnTo5YcNTc5hp4AaABAg,Ill stick to my 14 Pro Max. Maybe the 7th gen will be better.
Ugwnzxqe4z_eLny-bgF4AaABAg,Not enough competition.  Period.
Ugzoxp3N7xZYm-S-qkF4AaABAg,"I&#39;ll never buy a flip phone... I get the appeal, but yeah... not for me."
Ugy-mW31MpxOuIvVVmt4AaABAg,This was my first time ever not as impressed with MKBHD&#39;s first impressions. I await the full review first. This seemed to be the first impressions geared towards last year&#39;s purchasers. Someone who has owned Fold 3 needs a different perspective.
UgykDgA7m_uTJmhqfx54AaABAg,I have the fold 3 and it&#39;s STILL awesome. If you don&#39;t have one give it a try. You won&#39;t be disappointed
Ugylvn7IxTONjhCizo54AaABAg,"The thing about Samsung doubling down on their hardware design decisions is... no amount of re-releasing the same design is going to make a bad design good.<br><br>Curved display: dumb then, dumb now.<br>Tall fold: dumb then, really dumb now that other manufacturers have stared pointing out that they can just... not... do that.<br>Big phone: ...yeah, okay, that one was a pretty good idea actually. But up to a limit!"
UgznCAbmirmXxRiFKjN4AaABAg,"This is poor of Samsung.<br><br>There are way better foldables out there - Vivo Fold X, Magic V fold, One Plus fold etc... only reason Samsung is getting away with really jack squat innovation is because the aforementioned are not easily available in the U.S. market and thus no competition for Samsung."
UgxjRW7SyZKBSmC1lAh4AaABAg,First time I don&#39;t feel &quot;pressured&quot; to upgrade because the phones are so similar. I hate that the pen is not attached. I lost mine and never found it. I&#39;m not paying $100 for another one.

I would have loved to see the Fold pushing it‚Äôs way to a more mainstream price. At least this is probably great for Quality Assurance, things not changing much.<br><br>I think you‚Äôre being a bit hard on the Flip. It may be late to the party after Motorola made the entrance (and with a slightly better version), but that outside screen, if you can really put it to use, is still an absolutely great idea."

Ugy5lEnATaxI_m3--Y94AaABAg,never been interested in folding phones and wont be because of the inner crease. The outside display on the flip is very nice though
UgzZSkE6qSVPWs5glvZ4AaABAg,"Thanks, I don&#39;t want to upgrade my Fold4 this year then."
UgyOMdIZGTTvmdcOiUh4AaABAg,I would honestly want a much larger foldable than the fold5. Been using a fold 3 for two years now. I&#39;d want it to reach about 12 inches in 16:9 when unfolded. Would give you a square 15 cm phone when folded. Giving you a 1:1 outside screen at 8 inches.
Ugx4U48LqX9nik4gclx4AaABAg,"I think this also shows that even with the Pixel Fold out, Samsung still considers themselves with no equal in the US. Bet we see a more dramatic change after the Pixel Fold 2/3 comes out (if Google doesn&#39;t kill it that is)"
UgxunCezmFnkCwvmAxV4AaABAg,Any word on the next galaxy bud pros?
UgxrjXuh4ZyeS2m-8Cd4AaABAg,Chinese foldable phones from 5 years ago make any foldable phones sold in the USA look like a cheap piece of garbage.<br>Honor Magic V2 literally is lighter than an iPhone
UgylBNEXUh9j9Sni0nN4AaABAg,"PLEASE @Marques Brownlee, STOP doing the AI dub to spanish, its unpleasing to listen to, PLEASE hire a voice actor, dont be cheap dude"
UgzyYTahQvF2-d4buUJ4AaABAg,I&#39;m thinking of changing to the Pixel Fold from the Z Fold 4 instead of going to the Z Fold 5 mainly because I do use the cover display more than I thought I would over the last 4 generations that I&#39;ve been using the Fold. I just like the idea of a solid size cover display. I&#39;ve found the candy bar size tolerable but annoying for many apps that I use IMO. Plus little in the way of a refresh on hardware (besides the chip) and cameras is rather disappointing to me.
Ugz-cafmkYa6YRjwyg14AaABAg,"Both the flip and the fold and weird, overly tall screens... Why? Makes no sense."
UgwPqzvztLpJ645ofcZ4AaABAg,"Regular samsung if you want all the tech, fold flip for comon consumer and easily to fit the pocket"
UgzOn1Pw7163qHvHB2d4AaABAg,"More change was needed, but still good anyway"
UgxkoUySHYjMcPoaD594AaABAg,And people still dissing apple for small yearly improvements. Cellphone industry is stucked in a slow flow pond.
UgwghTrXmpbaOWHx0KV4AaABAg,This is what happens when there&#39;s less competition

UgxDvCBaSKv8zYa5sep4AaABAg,"I think it was a money making decision to not  change it. Google decided to chicken out of any market its wasn&#39;t able to be part of cheaply, and no other brands are even trying to push into this market. So why spin up new fabs when you have a captive audience.  Why waste time, when you own everything.<br><br> As a Canadian, when my phone from 2013 (ZTE Axon 7) dies, I am left with buying Samsungs (soon to be e-waste phones for extortionate prices, (Locking out rooting basically removes them from competition for me, i run my phones for 12 years, they are not gonna update it for that time if this wasn&#39;t the case, i would have already bought a s23 ultra I loved both my note 3 and Original note.) or Pay extortionate rates for an Iphone. In which case i would rather not have a phone.  And every phone google releases has some unexplainable limb tied behind its back for no reason. <br><br>I just eliminated all of the options in Canada. Literally. Heres hoping my phone lasts another 10 years. because I have yet to find one that isn&#39;t a downgrade in some way even though they cost double the money now. When it dies I will get a flip phone that can put up a hotspot, and it&#39;s time to buy a convertible laptop. I&#39;f I&#39;m going to pay laptop prices, why would I take a 5 year loan for a phone.  I just don&#39;t know what to do anymore.  I already cant afford my phone bill. now you want me to add 80/month to it because everything is now 599 and up?"
UgxXUbMWwfhKj3mJqTl4AaABAg,I want a video on the tablet and watches
Ugyo4gIWD2NM2cte1sB4AaABAg,Now.... If you format the OS of the fold will all the camaras break down? ü§îü´£
Ugw0n4rUMJdLtyWLpsV4AaABAg,"this is super disapointing to hear, after seeing the google pixel fold the fold 5 is a huge L, that front screen being so skinny is huge deal breaker compared to the shorter but wider front screen of the google pixel phone."
Ugym6A5qu7pJD6fVWRl4AaABAg,Sheesh even Marques sounds bored talking about these incremental changes.
Ugx2eQy7iE1GJ9vTGUh4AaABAg,"The Galaxy Mega would still feel massive today because of the aspect ratio, FYI"
UgxN2OF0rnUmHpoPopl4AaABAg,Bruh the tab ultra series is seriously a laptop. Surely u feel awkward holding the big tab in your hand. Surely can&#39;t use it when sitting on couch or lying down cuz it&#39;s heavy.
UgwkvzQCICDinVoFcnN4AaABAg,"He says they&#39;re settling, but this generation Fold is the first one that I&#39;ve been tempted to buy. I think they&#39;ve refined, not settled"
UgwURqnfvEE-UflA7b94AaABAg,"Buying new tires and leaving the shop with same tires you came in with, only difference is new stem in tires."

UgzNReI16eco0m5-MUl4AaABAg,Fold 5 is so bad Samsung just gave up compared to Chinas folding phones.
UgwoUZwHqbaJcNwtl454AaABAg,so gorgeous
Ugwj7btghQfnsCEf3Nt4AaABAg,Samsung is the new apple!
UgzBW7ob8TbcnjdSD_l4AaABAg,"Sigh, guess I&#39;ll wait to see what they do with the Fold 6."
Ugwu2T5AIp6JbnOD_fd4AaABAg,Speechless üò∂
Ugw-OhT87ozdhJPIuFp4AaABAg,So disappointed in the z fold 5 I have the 3 but guess I won&#39;t be updating til the 6
UgwZFSVMJc-wNX6sZYd4AaABAg,"I‚Äôm never spending that much money for a Fold when for the same price I can get a MacBook and a 15 Pro for similar money, the price is just crazy."
UgxE-ewUT0i5ChHHW154AaABAg,I guess this year the best product is the new galaxy watch classic. It is beautiful
Ugyr3ubusrR7768nfdN4AaABAg,My blind shot would be that the next move is a foldable tablet
UgxzHsWApTvRo_IG-Oh4AaABAg,I have the z fold 4 and decided not to get the 5 because there aren&#39;t much improvements - but the brighter inner screen is making me reconsider. That&#39;s my only gripe with the 4. I need the screen brighter outside.
UgxqYziaSYt-nCTXecJ4AaABAg,"The fact that Samsung is comfortable enough to barely make any major improvements in their folds and flips, in a whole year, tells you that there&#39;s no direct competition that they feel is a threat."
UgwNOlLzJBPMOgc-Jbx4AaABAg,"I got an old Z Flip 5G, Z Flip 3, Fold 3, and now a Razr+, and sadly, I&#39;m already kind of board with my new Razr+. I refuse to upgrade my Fold 3 because there&#39;s honestly no point. I was hoping that this year they would surprise us with the Tri-Fold and a 16:9 aspect ratio, but I knew that was too good to be true. Maybe next year, right?"
UgyFOYirNPY_C_PWi4h4AaABAg,Hope Marques finally gives us a review of a Galaxy Watch. They need more attention than he&#39;s previously given
UgyuKfNTTd1wQBWpz414AaABAg,Amazing upgrade!! I can stick to my fold 4 nowüòÇ
UgyuA-frZPW-Iyxg_Dx4AaABAg,Spanish audio? Nice!
UgwECWYC_Va1S7Chhuh4AaABAg,I wanted a better Fold 5 camera system. That&#39;s what is keeping me from trading my S23ULTRA
Ugw7SQq4_j1LC4Q8cDR4AaABAg,"someone ought to make a square-shaped phone screen, no flip doodad, just a square with a decent pared-down app suite."
UgzAT8zRYLyMnhhYTaV4AaABAg,I have had my Fold 3 since launch and I really want to get the google fold next as I think I will like that form factor. The down side is I don&#39;t think I want to pay the 1800 for the first attempt. Hopefully in the coming years they will drop in price so I can jump back in the fold space as I want to try out the pixel line so I think my n3xt phone will be the pixel 8 when it comes out.
UgyOXVNR3YuVdC5qjs94AaABAg,"I mean, the screens will break. It&#39;s not a what if its a when. This is known, it is docmented. Your folding screen will start to become damaged after using it for months."
UgxUuR28-YaqeW3rlWp4AaABAg,Same phone as the flip4. The price should actually went down by $100 or so we&#39;ll skip
UgxuaEPpliDgB77oldB4AaABAg,Bored devices! Not much better compare Moto flip
UgxgKeDABHJBuXFqZEp4AaABAg,"I reckon a flip would help most people with reducing screen time, is this right for anyone who actually got it?"
UgyyVIv1EJy4g_voixN4AaABAg,Went back to that rotating bezel on the watch pretty quick.  Was the whole reason I didn&#39;t get a 5 and stuck with my 4
UgyYBu8dF6sfa3bGzpR4AaABAg,"I&#39;ve always been a Galaxy fold user since the Fold 1,but I decide to switch to Mate X3 or Honor Magic V2 just because these two phones are super light and have a normal sized screen while the Galaxy phones are so heavy and the outside screens are so narrow that I can&#39;t take it anymore. üò¢"
UgwuTUlgxYK7sEv5aJB4AaABAg,So they did the Apple thing and gave us the same phone again
UgxAx7UMo4rwsPEXOi54AaABAg,"I want this title on the next iphone video, And I have an iphone."
UgxOhz9ygHYMxVjUgmp4AaABAg,you should wear the new SAMSUNG watch while reviewing these products leave that apple watch behind.
Ugw8XhfqKpMuRio4SEZ4AaABAg,They need to skip the flip 6 and fold 6 phones and go right to the flip 7 and fold 7. So it matches up with the galaxy watch 7 next year. They skipped the note 6 years ago so it could sync up with the S series devices. Why not do something similar for the folding phones?
UgyhhTtg3EdO0XRvtP94AaABAg,I would like to see Z flip in a non foldable version. Without selfie camera hole punch. Camera in the back with small screen can be used as selfie camera as well. Less camera lens and main screen without a selfie camera hole punch!
UgwAPy9W46qKorKQ3P54AaABAg,"Actually, I dont mind this. This means that there is no reason to upgrade, and the Fold 4 will be less expensive...so maybe i&#39;ll finally check it out."
UgwMUi1epOmSH7c4lCp4AaABAg,May be Next Year all over again!
UgxNKtr4mP28K8Mas-R4AaABAg,Next phones will be flexible and way more pleasurable to use
UgxJ8f1Wqex-_SlLRlR4AaABAg,Using the front display on the Fold 5 feels like using a remote. I still prefer Pixel Fold.
UgyiO_1XF4YV0-pLGlh4AaABAg,Debian on on a phone like this with proper software support would be insane
Ugyaoodie82SfN45DxR4AaABAg,Until the cover display gets wider I will never own a Fold again. I had the Fold 3 &amp; 4 and it physically hurts to text &amp; draft emails on the outer display. I hope they don&#39;t settle on this form factor for too much longer.
Ugxqz5JB7H9yHTV9rNh4AaABAg,Thank you
Ugxz22PBma_vvPIroXJ4AaABAg,The mega was fucking wild. Even when i had a note 2 everyone thought i had a ipad. Yall hit a wall here. And i dont know anyone really with a fold.
UgyD83jChaiTn4rXaGF4AaABAg,Can you do a review on the Sony X1000 M5 Earbuds please üôèüèª
UgyGkKrhcbBNfN6t4kF4AaABAg,"since my flip 4 basically does the samething, i&#39;m just going to keep it and wait for a major update to the flip."
Ugwtfi8pqTPEYxEJKzV4AaABAg,Samsung was a huge disappointment this year
UgxcGddSMs78BxAN6DR4AaABAg,Bro the s9 ultra looks gigantic wth
UgwuxNDl4hFbhln3o414AaABAg,"I needed 3 significant upgrades from the fold4 to make this my next phone, and seeing only the hinge upgrade implemented means I am happy to wait another year.  Let&#39;s see some battery/camera/stylus upgrades Samsung!"
UgxtHUL5Os4sNenMHEJ4AaABAg,"i skip gens for devices, have since the first galaxy as well as the watches. i had the flip 3 and the flip 5 is gona be a nice upgrade. wish they had dust protection but ü§∑ my s22+ is just too big even tho i love the battery."
UgwTLbQOpo2mZ0b0lwd4AaABAg,The Fold is over 3000$ on a 24 month plan in Canada. It&#39;s insane.
Ugyhg6DKkF2A-wOoo7p4AaABAg,Samsung is really falling off
UgyR537MrkRJyUlnfOx4AaABAg,Phones from 2012 being 3.5 inch lol
UgzoM87EXZzE0ZvWH-x4AaABAg,"They made the outer screen way bigger, changed the hinge mechanics, new ways to interact with the screen‚Ä¶ Settled is a mix of reality and clickbait in this context ü§≠"
Ugz9HwJsr7ch8DQQi7h4AaABAg,bruh i thought then newest was the flip and fold 3
UgwP5s2skwiP-yhtw9l4AaABAg,Never Settledüò¢
UgzTlGvvf79JCxCUyj94AaABAg,Unsubscribing because Arun did a review and he actually tested it with no shortcuts like you are. I just wasted 10 mins cause i couldnt keep watching the lack of details in this. Youre obviously an apple fanboy
Ugy8VZ6EPRoRkSvk9VN4AaABAg,It honestly doesn&#39;t need more.
Ugwtga5dmnPWL_UvFN94AaABAg,"The Fold with new stronger glass, brighter screen, new slimmer folding mechanism, updated software and new pen is a signficant change and improvement imo.  Sure, new cameras and battery would have been nice, but this is a solid improvement by most peoples standards.  Others note that it gets 1 hr longer battery with the same battery (thus points to software improvements). I&#39;m using both an iPhone and Galaxy and upgrading my S10+ to the S23 (likely the iPhone iPhone 15 next year) but can&#39;t fault Sammy for a solid upgrade for this gen."
UgxJKc2FhqH8fr_wn6x4AaABAg,I want the flip ‚ù§
Ugy6LwHLC9c_1iPfweJ4AaABAg,"To be honest, the weirdest part to me is not having a slot for the S-Pen.  That was the most glaring oversight last year."
Ugx1ASsmIRis3tLy2pR4AaABAg,agree on the tallness. also not keen on the shape. it would be good if they had a design similar to the Huawei Mate XS which is simitrical on both sides
UgyWuWPahGV07EQCa3d4AaABAg,Total flop of a phone the fold is this year. I‚Äôm gonna just stick to the slab. I got a fold 3 and it had issues with sound not working when it was open. Disappointing at best. I really wanted to like it but it‚Äôs back to iPhone for me.
UgyJIKYitDF3wk53Qo54AaABAg,"Samsung isn&#39;t going to innovate in this space until someone comes in to challenge them. The Pixel Fold, the Oppo, etc. are all great but they aren&#39;t seeing sales in numbers that would make Samsung worry in any way."
UgwwJUHcOFfPYNjKFcJ4AaABAg,I love that these things are getting mature
UgyPlOELiIXtLbyJBrh4AaABAg,One thing I&#39;ve noticed gradually happening over time is the over-use of people&#39;s hands when talking. It&#39;s unnatural and distracting. We don&#39;t normally talk like this.
Ugzc9oLEO-dJu2nz5I14AaABAg,Seems like tech is starting to reach it&#39;s peak
Ugx85cnCqGNU6MQQGtl4AaABAg,Big disappointed as compared to Motorola
UgwXoYHlKcBnjccRhAF4AaABAg,It would have been cool if they were to use the Huawei size phone for the fold as well as the hinges but kept the Samsung technology
UgxiN8SvtGILj1lQgl14AaABAg,"S23+ was a wild departure for Samsung. My parents cycle through them every other year and its the first Samsung theyve had that doesn&#39;t scream Samsung to me. Its very wide compared to the old ones, and very round. Pretty much an iPhone till you turn it on. Maybe they&#39;&#39;ll come around on the fold as well"
UgylJhpAoBzCUEpT92l4AaABAg,I agree. I have the Fold 3 and the Flip 4 and decided not to get either of the 5 phones. Nothing exciting to spend $1000 on.
UgzLuoNKIj3WaQ1NvRt4AaABAg,"So the flip is doing what the original flip folds did back in the 00s. No screen, little screen, then bigger screens in the outside lol. Flat phones became a thing for a reason I don‚Äôt get why we are going backwards. <br><br>Now for the fold it‚Äôs to damn expensive to try it just because. People got into cell phones because it was just cheap enough to try and then they were stuck forever. I just don‚Äôt see a real reason to switch to a fold. The passport ones looks more enticing but still no. I hope apple never makes a folding phone so slab phones can stay alive forever"
UgzJCL0QdzZmO5NX5_d4AaABAg,I HATE the form factor and that tall skinny phone. <br><br>It should be passport sized and the Pixel Fold nailed it.
UgyTKi0jzEukOxZ9--d4AaABAg,"I&#39;ve had a Fold 4 for 10 months and I&#39;m not really convinced on upgrading. I don&#39;t care that it folds slightly flatter, I also don&#39;t like the placement of the flash. Get over the form factor, it&#39;s all roughly the same open and many (including myself) prefer the candy bar shape over slab. Now if I could just have googles photo quality in my Fold 4"
Ugwx_IO68b97ekiY9vl4AaABAg,"I had bought the Z Fold 3 when it first came out and it was my first foldable phone.<br>Was excited at first but after 6 months, I couldn&#39;t deal with that outer display. <br>Yeah I get the main purpose is to use the bigger display the majority of the time but there were a lot of time where I didn&#39;t want to use the bigger display and just wanted to text using the smaller. But it&#39;s so small (isn&#39;t wide enough) and nearly impossible to do so. So I&#39;m always forced to use the bigger display.<br>Ended up trading it in and got the S22 Ultra.<br>I&#39;m just waiting for the day where Samsung will make there foldable phone like the Xiaomi phone or the recent reveal of the Google fold, than I will get another Z Fold.<br>Til then, I&#39;ll wait..."
UgyPaP13yZK_eqod0pN4AaABAg,Uuhuhuu Victus 2 like that matters when the inside screen is as fragile as it is. Kind of pointless. Samsung stagnated this gen&#39;s foldables.
Ugyj6pA0tKcIMYIjYgR4AaABAg,I am not buying any samsung phone anymore. üì≤  they dont care about their customers.
UgwbpVqvqSU_zU4u6Yh4AaABAg,"I still think Z Fold is fundamentally flawed - you spend most of the time using it in your hand with the external screen. It&#39;s not big enough, the external screen is too narrow, the internal screen could also be wider and more tablet like. If they added about half an inch to the width of the external screen it would be perfect. You&#39;d have a proper phone and tablet experience in the same device, instead of a compromised experience for both."
UgwgSsAsD-2OaOCSwzJ4AaABAg,MKBHD: i will just criticise it until Apple copies it .
UgzrTP69_PBoDQPqw2h4AaABAg,"Can&#39;t wait for Apple to invent flip smartphones, so I can get one."

UgyZJNejcH9EZmDg15Z4AaABAg,IPHONE FLIP!?
UgxoijpawFBQ_KJWq1h4AaABAg,"Still rocking a Fold 3, but upgrade time is coming. No real complaints on the fold 3 other than battery life but that&#39;s also because I use it intensive"
UgzkQr8hdzQBg6eyxuB4AaABAg,Why do they keep putting screens on the outside. This defeats the entire allure of flip phones for the sake of convenience for some people. I‚Äôd just end up using the front screen most of the time. The FLIP is the POINT.
UgyKdHkLwcGUy8i_XZ14AaABAg,"Previously<br>Samsung Users: iPhones never change every year, imagine paying for the same thing<br><br>This year<br>Samsung Users: <b>**Left the chat**</b>"

Ugw16FzXhiE84kBzelJ4AaABAg,"As soon as they figure out how to integrate the pen into the fold, I&#39;ll get it"
Ugx17nNh-SjYdLmHBcN4AaABAg,"I Want to jump into a foldable , but the  battery size is concerning . I own the pixel 7 with a bigger battery , and it does not make it through the day without charging :/Wondering if  the battery is more efficient on these phones :/"
UgwNRIbBPBBIv-UMyzJ4AaABAg,"The bad thing is the inside screens are tough as plastic, they can scratch at a level 2, your nail can mark it.   How is that worth any money?"
UgwahmF5KdfjJZq7PHd4AaABAg,"Samsung can do this. Same as Apple. If you praise Apple, then don&#39;t complain when another big company do the same. Consistency marquees."
UgwqA_m_XGqcda8ASP94AaABAg,FLIP 5 VS NEW RAZR PLEASEEEEEEEEEE
UgzbW4sKgQXmi520TpJ4AaABAg,"Unpopular opinion here:<br>The option to use a modern flagship phone single handed with access to a huge screen at will WITH S PEN SUPPORT is what makes the Fold series so appealing. I have average sized hands and yes, typing on the &quot;narrow&quot; outer Fold 4 screen was noticeably more difficult at first. However, with a little practice I became proficient at it and im sure others can agree to my point. Lets not forget at one point in time some of us were T9 gods üòÇ<br>The pixel folds outer screen requires two hands just like any other massive slab phone and due to the software bugs causing inconsistent aspect ratios on the inner screen you might as well use a traditional flagship phone."
Ugz-ZOqvMkQOS0i7QLx4AaABAg,Is battery in the 5 fold better than last years model?
UgyfgEXpCtts2UgonBt4AaABAg,"I like tall and narrow screen form factor, so I wish Samsung keep it."
Ugx7y0KnaNED91YztLR4AaABAg,Hey bro how about you send me one of those many phones you have?
Ugxj5CL0yLzxsXyulHl4AaABAg,"I really like my z flip 3, but I think I‚Äôll be heading back to normal phones soon.  The issue of two ..‚Äùfold‚Äù.  First is that the pricing is too high and you end up locked into it for uncomfortably long period of time.  Secondly, the trade-in/resale value seems horrible compared to other phones.   Essentially I don‚Äôt want to pay full price for it but I also don‚Äôt want to be stuck with it for 3 years. <br><br>It also needs camera improvements.  At least my z flip 3‚Äôs camera isn‚Äôt good enough especially not for the price."
Ugzw8Gk3McnRDmfFC6l4AaABAg,Should have put the pen inside
Ugzu3HZBQVOGfRbavzh4AaABAg,"I tried out a flip at the phone store and I immediately said HELL NO, I‚Äôll stick to iphone"
UgyogLVwWVd9zEXS-514AaABAg,"I tried the fold 4 last year for a couple of weeks and the size of the outside screen was a no no for me. Plus the 4mp inside camera and the terrible battery life, I had to send it back. I feel like Google has done better with the outside screen size and the inside camera. I think if I summoned the courage to try another foldable, it would be the Google fold (for now)"
UgyjA4_Q4Js7ZWdIeXF4AaABAg,Honor v2 is a real Enovation
Ugw2RuSYEbxJh9n7rWN4AaABAg,"The fold needs better cameras, battery life, s-pen slot, wider front screen"
Ugyz8mZMnLpWR7NCZjp4AaABAg,Ahhh smart folding phones. Can finally send emails in a burner phone.
UgydBwQNUp8AbdrO3JJ4AaABAg,"honestly there is nothing impressive about these phones anymore, doesn&#39;t matter what the manufacturer is. nothing new, just overhyped minor changes. I will be super impressed when a flagship device is below $800, that will be something refreshing."
UgwUZxEVwaxDrzctugR4AaABAg,Pixel fold better size
Ugz8CGlHn-v0mQxidwd4AaABAg,Not good

UgzK4F-tetSQMnOmFpJ4AaABAg,"Dangggg Marques, you keep samsung in check and accountable"
UgxW0ynetydj5ml_DLh4AaABAg,"I&#39;ve been using a fold 3 since the week it was released, so almost 2 years. The hinge made a popping noise when i opened it a couple days ago and the screen broke directly on the crease. Decided to go s23 ultra and I had forgotten what I was missing. My 2 real complaints about the folds are app optimization and front screen aspect ratio. Until all my apps work correctly on the fold it&#39;s not worth it. For media consumption the fold is hard to beat, but it can&#39;t overcome its software shortcomings. Using the s23 ultra the past couple days has really made the app optimization issues that much more glaring."
UgxflcOeZuhdX9AqbWR4AaABAg,People want a wider screen for the fold phone. There&#39;s should be two versions the narrow screen and the plus wider screen.
Ugz-lkcB1xJ25fsfl4t4AaABAg,still narrow screen on folded fold. they will never learn
UgxKMJz77wE4UK2BRsZ4AaABAg,No reason to upgrade from previous version lost the excitement to upgrade

UgzjRLUEg2s8dvIl-vZ4AaABAg,Galaxy mega my first android phone huge phone üòÇ üòÇ
Ugzy2Wjpejkax6FvzFx4AaABAg,I thought Flip phones made sense for protecting the screen but now I&#39;m starting to get confused with what purpose they really serve with a casing thats pretty much all glass and screen. I guess the profile is smaller but you compromise so much durability for it. Flip doesnt make sense- Fold on the other hand does make sense.
UgyrUCFGpWqZ51Y9jVh4AaABAg,"Its going to be fascinating to see fold phones 10 years from now, I believe its the future of mobile phone. This will look comically thick and unwieldy compared to what we will prob see 5-10 years from now. Foldables are still sort of in their infancy, when process nodes shrink further as they do every few years or so (thanks to engineers) we will prob have super thin foldable, that is when mass adoption will occur. Foldables will likely become the standard and tablets will be almost obsolete, except for some use cases like artists who make use of pro tablets."
UgxF8mVsnFQBKWHoEh94AaABAg,Why is the video in spanish? üòê
UgxfCK0qiqTxpEaji694AaABAg,"Excellent review - thanks!<br>I&#39;m fairly pleased with my Fold 4. Complaints? Cases are clunky, hard to work with. Too narrow - Marques got that right. WAY too short battery life. But then also pretty heavy. You can&#39;t stuff more battery into a wider form factor &amp; have it weigh less.<br><br>It isn&#39;t quite a tablet: I&#39;d hoped it would be. But while it&#39;s better for reading articles, it isn&#39;t a tablet and certainly not a reading device like Kobo&#39;s or Remarkable&#39;s tablets. &lt;sigh&gt;<br><br>I need to invest a ton of time &amp; learn to multitask properly on this thing. But overall, I suspect the next phone will be something closer to a regular one. My last - Galaxy Note 10 - was a perfect form factor. And I&#39;ll have to bite the bullet &amp; get a tablet for reading. One device to do it all: not bad but not the answer I&#39;d hoped it would be."
UgwH9AnSLuX5Sx3El9x4AaABAg,Why tf would they give it the same camera like seriously its the most expensive phone they have it should atleast have the same cameras as the current ultra line . I have the fold 4 and love it to death but my only gripe is the camera isnt half as detailed as the 21 ultra i trade in for this phone . Which i was fine with because the 5 was xoming and i though it was common f***ing sense it would come with their best cameras . Also woden the front screen its so uncomfortable . I mainly use it open but the small amount of times i do have to use the main screen its a pain every single time .
UgwvG9uh2NIDX_oN8AN4AaABAg,Why the fuck did I get an Spanish audio when I started the video?
Ugy8KoEY90ewvgwGkpd4AaABAg,Can you text from Z flip&#39;s cover screen? That would be awesome
UgwUeOsx6c1G0sCSK9h4AaABAg,I can&#39;t wait for the 6th Gen. I feel something big coming for that Gen.
Ugzqzy7QtKS1YuG_U9R4AaABAg,Folding phones becoming the new thing would be fascinating for people who lived through the flip phone era.
UgwjQLhth5xGInj8b5R4AaABAg,I bought the Google pixel fold and I&#39;m do much satisfied with it
UgyYmEXU9cnM-l2J11x4AaABAg,Samsung is LAZY.
UgyOPaDQjAP-qTJyAql4AaABAg,"Dang, 5th Gen already. They are advancing quick."
UgxpwSgxLMUQR4cUMHR4AaABAg,"They will always make a detachable keyboard for the 14inch tablet, i feel is way too oversized to be a tablet."
UgxKqEOCME_JqqxxCep4AaABAg,I think it could be that they just aren&#39;t selling as many folding and flip phones as they thought they would and are reusing as many of the old chassis&#39; as possible while adding in a few changes
Ugz0fHoJ9_atW8jVV1l4AaABAg,Need that tablet!
UgzSeO9z5sFpB5TAY0N4AaABAg,Honestly just sounds very disappointing. Changes are too minute to even spend money on. Look @ oppo or one plus.
UgxaqUyClfLjEIfC0HJ4AaABAg,I want it!
Ugx0TEBtUXJpfZo8tOF4AaABAg,"Here is What I think.<br>Samsung did these Minor Upgrade Intentionally,<br>They are planning very much Big for the Next year (or maybe the year after next year) in their R&amp;D."
UgyGHm69NRqnp6GPr9Z4AaABAg,All i use is youtube for everything so i am  Subseptible to screen burn (galaxy 8+) will this be good enough to limit that on low light image display
UgxZyDQ4_SygSpBPgWh4AaABAg,"If the Fold had a slot for the s-pen like the S-Ultra does, I&#39;d get it."
Ugypcd4ahINckJAdsEx4AaABAg,"Samsung&#39;s settling because there&#39;s NO COMPETITION thanks to the US Congress.  The Chinese brands -- Huawei, Oppo, Xiaomi, etc. are still trying to innovate and pushing for new boundaries in the foldable market, but they&#39;ve been excluded from the US market in the name of &quot;national security&quot; (remember &quot;weapon of mass destruction&quot; from a decade ago?  This is just a repeat of the same lie).  So at the end you get this -- a duopoly of Apple and Samsung with zero motivation to innovate."
UgwJcSWfJ3k4T-99OpV4AaABAg,Somebody at Samsung must&#39;ve not paid out this month&#39;s retainer lol
UgweTKveT9F9POyFG0Z4AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m06s"">5:06</a> anyone else noticed the animation for the flip and fold are...flipped?"
UgxPgBZIajoaL74jvoB4AaABAg,Hey marques could you do a video about the tab s9
UgycJXbUfy6FlckiFZx4AaABAg,"Too expensive. Nice and great I‚Äôm sure but I can‚Äôt lay out a rent payment (Chicago area so yeah, e-x-p-e-n-s-I-v-e) for one."
UgxfRcKBv3LP8RTTIV94AaABAg,flip kooks nice. im digging my razr plus. <br><br>no ragrets! :)
UgzfGsMOyJGuQ2oincZ4AaABAg,&quot;The exact same&quot; review. well done.
UgyHIUdSQlIuo9BkZy94AaABAg,ok so Samsung settles but when aplle make exactly the same phone as the last year then its the best thing ever ? :)
Ugz5jF_VB-8z66CsgFp4AaABAg,Motorola needs to do better marketing
Ugw8ewVFTvrDStXQ1xp4AaABAg,Think it&#39;s worth the upgrade from a zfold 2?
UgxfFH8AtfBDiE-fd0B4AaABAg,Flip looks similar to what Motorola has done
UgzGyBHWISmrttsFJdh4AaABAg,Cool. Glad to keep my fold 4 for at least another year
UgzyHJj0cKyzomjZyzB4AaABAg,FAKE AMELSELSE BWELWEOWENENE ACCOFUNTE IMPRESSION! IT SETTLED!
UgxAtHTRAmXJCMcJAAJ4AaABAg,still a crease. still not buying it.
UgynX6WPuQ8RJ5a9kKh4AaABAg,14.5 inches is ridiculous!
UgykdjF84ApLGIwWJfZ4AaABAg,"I had a Z Fold 4, lasted for about 9 months. It started to have power issues. When open and closing from the inner and outer screen; it would shut off. Once in awhile, i can power it back on. ü§¶. Had to go get an unlocked S23 Ultra at BBY."
Ugxdvi_YSPUytSW0n2h4AaABAg,I tried and handled a folded phone in a store just a few days ago and when opened up I could feel the inverse bumpy part very clearly with my thumb. I wouldn&#39;t want that type of smartphone on THAT fact alone. Move on people.
UgwIzTncSTykD0whgP14AaABAg,I am very nervous about the fact that the phone now folds completely flat like the Pixel Fold. I sense it will have all the same problems of the display getting wrecked by micro scraches since there will always be some amount of dust and dirt on your phone display and pressing that between two soft pieces of plastic won&#39;t end well.
UgzaX0-y_NXs2UW8crp4AaABAg,"To me I already knew it was going to be an incremental upgrade. But that&#39;s why I like it. Take an already solid Fold 4 and give it the latest specs and minor hardware improvements and you have a guaranteed success. Apple does the same thing, and its a good idea! Tried and true tech with minor upgrades make for a solid buy. Marketing my friends. üòÖ"
UgwA8d3sg-51310Zuwx4AaABAg,Would be funny if the pen folded too
UgzCty25c60d5TasOXN4AaABAg,"I actually really enjoy the narrow-nature of my fold4, it&#39;s great for what the cover screen is mostly (at least in my case) used for. And that could be reading an article, scrolling through discrod, occasionally sendting texts, and other such things. Typing on the cover screen is okay, but I can always just open to the main screen whenever I want and use that whenever something isn&#39;t great for the cover screen, like a video, a game, or typing longer strings of text. I originally had a fold3, and the different aspect ratios of the fold4 is the main reason I upgraded, it made it easier to use."
Ugw_50m4f931iPvi8054AaABAg,I wished apple did a flip
Ugy4-3zc6HA7ARMd60l4AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m50s"">5:50</a>  well u probably never has Huawei Mate 20 X in hands  which has 7.2&#39;&#39; screen and that was awesome had the phone for 4 years ..Now I upgraded last year"
UgxpFPoAEHkTHAef0IB4AaABAg,We‚Äôve gotten to the point where the secondary screen on our smart phones is as big as the main screen on smart phones from 10 years ago
UgxoZEFkDz-BDNOdZTF4AaABAg,That outside screen is brutal. Completely unusable.  Really wished the fold borrowed the oppo/pixel design
Ugx4piFAoLkDNEwPzJd4AaABAg,"Samsung acts as if they found the sweep spot, when they aren&#39;t even close."
UgxudMPrSRZ74k9amaF4AaABAg,I disagree with you with that 30 fps... 60 fps or 120 fps is way to go...
UgyHcQAkJ-mmW49fwId4AaABAg,I loved my Mega. lol
Ugy9u7coYyeeH6XZ0Gp4AaABAg,Still alone the price tag is insane
UgxK9STK0KBy6WKxmnl4AaABAg,Doesn&#39;t sound like I&#39;m gonna upgrade from Fold 3 still.
UgyAZ7JOhJifMUil26p4AaABAg,"Having the fold 3, I don&#39;t see enough of a difference to upgrade<br> Hopefully next year will be more worthy"
UgzrKMBNPJ7vrjxvLn14AaABAg,"This is absolutely a second hand purchase type of phone. Wait until the FOMO people want the next phone and then buy this one for like ¬£300-400, Get it a new battery and enjoy a great phone. I&#39;ve owned a fold 3 now for a couple of year now and as a heavy user its still great. Foldables in my opinion are just a stop gap for the big leap that has got to occur soon, which is a completely new form factor for the idea of a phone in general. Whether that&#39;s glasses, a chip installed in our head a projected wrist band type deal idk."
Ugx2OZct-F25Ph5c5Gx4AaABAg,These devices aren&#39;t for people with Z4 phones. I surmise Samsung &amp; Apple know that and aren&#39;t troubled by tiny changes year to year and focus on larger changes over a few years. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Ugy6uFmB4IXMab1qkPp4AaABAg,I am disappointed in Samsung. I am considering the pixle fold now.
Ugy_28tZfLinfjy6ImF4AaABAg,I need the pen If I will have to pay 1700$ for a phone.
UgxSas0tQmdl-788ZwF4AaABAg,The omission of DeX on the Flip 5 is unacceptable.
UgyDa8Vax3wskhfuqjB4AaABAg,Fold 4 here and love it. Only problem I have on it is texting when closed
Ugxf-_DcTptGCMrwSNN4AaABAg,I have flip 4 and i love it. Thought id get sick of the folding but i still love it hehe. The camera is sooo good man
Ugy0HNP8AmuGXFFahy54AaABAg,"ZZZZzzzzzz disappointing, just iterative nothing groundbreaking."
UgxjQxjMQ0WV0B0CZTh4AaABAg,Sorry marcus- Loving my razr so much now. It came out first in uk for some weird reason. Had mine since launch date. its nice to see i wont be upgrading the mrs phone just yet who insits on samsung. I do like samsung however moto all the way after seeing this.
UgwfCvk5Gwb4GvlXES94AaABAg,People need bigger screen for better in gaming and watching movies and good speaker dats it even children don&#39;t want to play smaller screen..
Ugzi2frrPa_KNHoaDqZ4AaABAg,Looks like I will be sticking with my Z Fold 3. Still see no real reason to upgrade to these new ones. Maybe next year?
UgxKE4Lu_sVQSFO4REN4AaABAg,I was waiting fold5 come out in order to compare 4 n5 . <br>Umm I guess I will go with fold4 for my first impression of these kinda foldable phone
UgyQg9xPHFTGvW3Q5xZ4AaABAg,Can someone explain the recurring 30fps joke?
Ugzx1UH9D6mcSjWZAGt4AaABAg,I get it because foldable devices can&#39;t be changed drastically like a regular phone cause it takes years to engineer. Compare it to Galaxy S Series. It&#39;s flat so it&#39;s much easier to change the design and be more aggressive.
UgywlxjQpWEDN5ipRwd4AaABAg,"Hey the subtitles are broken, it just shows them all at once in one massive paragraph"
UgzQpXYmCNpyAyj8Z1J4AaABAg,"Why do people keep moaning that it looks the same? If it aint broke dont fix it! How far can things really chaneg i mean jesus the days of crazy designs are gone,  just tweak and improve."
UgygOMZmX_LAjSe2Ivd4AaABAg,Just ordered my flip. The trade ins are epic
Ugy2HTK3U_CnEaVBmz94AaABAg,Them creases are still a major put off
Ugxz3hAnHqdzyEjlKCN4AaABAg,"After being a lifelong Samsung user I got the Z fold 2. Myriad of problems and inside screen broke after they repaired the charging port. Refused to fix the screen under warranty. Saying I caused it which was obviously impossible to prove I didn&#39;t.<br><br>Finally made me go apple and after using the 13 Pro max for a year now, I will never go back. Also will never purchase another Samsung product for as long as I live. Managed to convince 4 people in my life to ditch Samsung for iphone and will never stop trying to convince more people to switch away from Samsung. Also bonus point managed to sway my aunt away from their expensive TV purchase from Samsung to the better LG. üòä"
Ugw6EOM6AHFqhKmqjaN4AaABAg,"I understand the attraction to the flip , it‚Äôs a tiny form factor that will fit in a woman‚Äôs purse or tiny pocket , it‚Äôs very unobtrusive as far as taking up space.<br>The galaxy fold not so much , it‚Äôs form factor when closed is just bloody awful  imo , how many really want an outer display that‚Äôs like a tv remote ? I know I don‚Äôt !<br>It may be kinda usable for people with girly hands in a limited way , but it‚Äôs in no way useful as a normal wider slab phone , and if you have biggish hands , it‚Äôs just utter crap meaning you have to open the thing up nearly all the time , which means way more wear and tear  on the hinge and on the crease in the display , and there‚Äôs plenty of evidence from owners in forums sooking about fold screens having problems .<br>To me it would be hard to justify spending all that coin on a device that is actually in many ways worse than the humble slab phone we have had for many years  , personally I‚Äôd rather have a galaxy note with all the proper galaxy note features , if samsung put an 8 gen 2 in a galaxy note 9 with some tweaks to the camera I‚Äôd be at the phone shop today buying one .<br> Another point of contention for me , is the fact these folds have to wear the protective plastic film to protect it , and due to it ( the fold ) not being proper glass very quickly becomes a greasy mess in daily use and gets tons of micro scratches in a short period of time .<br>Not really a fold fan , but if I had to , I‚Äôd have a look at the pixel fold , that seems to be a sensible form factor , however I still think for the compromises you get with the  folding devices ( not the flip) , they are still way too expensive."
UgwSko4yIiRvAcfIlyB4AaABAg,I miss the Old Samsung üò¢
UgzLT3GVS6P-RY6qORB4AaABAg,"These devices have 3 new features: <br>1. It repels social contact. 90% of people you meet, you won&#39;t see them use these and the rest of the people you meet using these you won&#39;t see them again. <br>2. This is not innovation. This is innovation crying out for lord mercy. Putting 3+ cameras, 3+ screens 3x battery is more desperation than disruption. Frankly it resembles grandpas sugar &amp; pressure device more than a futuristic tablet. <br>3. The ads itself features dumb tik tokers. Samsung should donate the tech &amp; money  it spends for folding devices for children&#39;s corrective eye surgery or a grassroots  Korean soccer team."
UgxKlTwT80XjG_OrRAZ4AaABAg,Why do you post your videos ay like 2 am
UgxcsfgchrowMmVeiVZ4AaABAg,So these are skips if you have one already I would only get one if it&#39;s time to replace a old phone
Ugz_n7TPczibXeADBZV4AaABAg,I do wonder if the inclusion of UFS 4.0 v 3.1 makes as much of a difference as the hype published about the new version earlier in the year.
UgxIJ2FcCnL_qsM2Gxp4AaABAg,just gimmicks that you never use with terrible cameras
Ugz6VcxPEtF3YbkRIHd4AaABAg,Awesome
Ugx6QGxpYDqFGvJTMy94AaABAg,"Still waiting for a tri-fold phone. I mean half the time we spend on phones is for entertainment, why not make a phone that folds out into a 16:9 aspect ratio... or at least close"
Ugw6IJ4Cl3Vol-4fW6R4AaABAg,"Camera sucks on my Fold4, no reason to upgrade"
UgynlmOY_wk2rBrtcnx4AaABAg,"Trying to remember the last time I saw a YouTuber not tell us they are curious to know what we think in the comments, even when they get too many comments to even think about reading them all üòÇ   I guess it really helps the algorithm and monetization when videos get a lot of comments!"
Ugw81_4lIB4ZYLUTc8l4AaABAg,I love the Z flip 5 but mahn that s9 ultra tablet... sheeesh!
UgzeogjofC9HmrrZSqB4AaABAg,Your voice in Spanish üíÄ
UgzTbjraVAobzz71EHR4AaABAg,"Samsung know what they&#39;re doing. It&#39;s all a money making ploy. They know what the will be doing for the next 5 years. Do you think a company like Samsung worth billions with the best tech people would make a fold that couldn&#39;t close properly or a flip with such a small display at the front by accident.They did it because they can gradually make more money from adjusting a few minor things people will crave and throw it back on the market same price or higher, thus make people want it with minimal man hours = more revenue. This is actually great strategy as a business but not for consumer, guess that depends who you ask. IPhone did the same with 13 and 14."
Ugw69LnOgcCeG06QHwZ4AaABAg,I still have my galaxy mega lmao!!!! I now own the flip 4 and it&#39;s great for what I use it for.
Ugxu_Cjze0Zq1tWuuM94AaABAg,"What a great phones, SAMSUNG leads innovation."
UgzaP3amnkJQD5vl5Op4AaABAg,"Is not about aesthetics, folds, color, camera, resolution and frame rate. It&#39;s all about how durable they are?"
UgyBxVjqwQrWFC1VzWN4AaABAg,"so what you&#39;re saying is, Samsung experiments with something to see if people like it. If so, they work on said devices until its as best as they could make it? Great, beats having the same exact phone over the years. I dont see iphones(which i also love) getting shit for staying the same.<br><br>As for the tablets, im weary of those, i prefer my ipad"
UgzcvXW_Q1kVZ7edBYN4AaABAg,Thank you Marques for ya work
Ugxm9piK7LPf2bBoK1h4AaABAg,"I&#39;ve used 4 Samsung ultra high end&#39;s phones until 2019 and every time after 2 years, I started seeing issues with every model. Using apple since 2019 and not yet see a reason why I need an upgrade?"
UgzuJFy38FHuDc89SAN4AaABAg,"If this was apple, there‚Äôd be at least 4 videos for this stuff. He‚Äôs so full on for apple and that‚Äôs it. Pretty sad."
UgwtlFgi-feJ0NJP5u94AaABAg,Don&#39;t fix what ain&#39;t broken. Fold 4 is my favorite phone I ever owned.
UgzZxKmlG_4bs_xAAn94AaABAg,Samsung should sponsor the Cantina Band in Star Wars.
UgwtV0UNBr7oojRHVCt4AaABAg,Tesla app/widget run on flip halfscreen?
UgzfgKFwSEwzyfI6eC54AaABAg,"I chose the new Motorola Razr+ instead of the Flip5, and am glad I did. One big advantage of the Razr+ is that you can use apps on the cover screen, while the Flip 5 is limited to a group of widgets.The larger cover screen is also nice. So far, I am very pleased with the Razr+."
UgwekAZw1WlE7xa3Gi54AaABAg,"After 10 months of use, my zfold4&#39;s hinge started malfunctioning and wouldn&#39;t open flat anymore. Glad to hear the new hinge will be more durable."
Ugx7pKrnmoXhQa4ow8l4AaABAg,The honor Magic V2 looks way better !! I would Buy that one If I were into foldables... They&#39;re still very expensive and I don&#39;t trust the durability
Ugww1CBErUrv8PIILs14AaABAg,The tall and narrow aspect of the fold is soooo much better than the wide pixel. Why the fuck would I buy a foldable phone to watch YT on the small front screen? Literally all you need the front screen for is texting.
Ugzqg-zZA7tYFoUc27h4AaABAg,Z flip definitely an eye catcher
UgwuISBJTANT-p2vryF4AaABAg,if samsung settles... what about apple? come on Marques...
Ugyl3mgjwseqw-Y6hSR4AaABAg,"I want a new phone, currently using a Samsung Note 20 Ultra, and I have no idea what to get.<br>Do I get a new Samsung Fold, or a new Samsung Flip, do I wait and go over to an iPhone 15 Pro Max?<br>I&#39;m not using it for business, no gaming, just phone, YouTube, and web search.<br>I&#39;ve got no idea what to do?"
UgxmkLl-wJFLCWCbvj14AaABAg,how disappointing to see they kept such a bad camera on an $1800 phone!
UgwzOWdrhO6kV9pkiE54AaABAg,It is more reasonable to go with Vivo Fold X2
Ugzy3ijt7UkN-lj_3Dt4AaABAg,Wake me up when transparent phones hit the market üò¥
UgxNms9oD_8Xdbf7_nZ4AaABAg,"Wow, these are worthless &quot;upgrades&quot; lol. My Fold 3 had screen issues, and I traded in my Flip 4 before it could break too as it started to have micro cracks. I guess I will just wait for a Fold 6 if it has an S-pen."
Ugw0TtC_L3UtzLtXmPh4AaABAg,"They are charging 1799 but not providing flagship camera is a bit disappointment, might be they want to keep it exclusive to S series only"
UgxBEe0ao78n5c8YxUd4AaABAg,Honor magic v2 that&#39;s all anyone needs to know.<br>Samsung take note on how to make a Foldable device
UgzbT6sACm0HZKNlFZt4AaABAg,Almost same phone and that is why I am not gonna change my Fold 4
UgyUpRQShct1IrCblah4AaABAg,"I&#39;m totally fine with it looking the same, I want it to just be better and it is! I&#39;ve already ordered and this will be my first foldable."
UgwgA5e0TL6hmBIXu6x4AaABAg,You would think with Samsung low sales they would innovate more. I think I&#39;m going back to IPhone
UgxKSl0c8r5tDqNa6994AaABAg,"I like the improvements to the Flip 5. The cover screen will be more usable, the cameras have improved and they will have optimized apps coming soon."
UgzMQAQS0XlUhi3oYyN4AaABAg,All is the same but prices ü§£
Ugxjem6XBukAC7SFUyx4AaABAg,Should I wait till Gen 6 to upgrade my z fold 3 then?
Ugyr4ywxNCLs2IGhDfl4AaABAg,Quite disappointed with this new release from Samsung. I was hoping not to see the crease on this Z fold 5. The battery is still the same as the old model. No S pen integration like the S 23 Ultra. This release is not necessary at all.
UgxmMSb0gj0JmevmxvF4AaABAg,"Had my flip 4 for 3months in oct/22, dropped it about 12 inches broke the hinge and I had the most protective robust plastic case on it. Pure crap build. The Samsung screen protector has delaminate at the fold area more junk.<br>Had a Note 8 for 5 years the best handset I&#39;ve ever owned.<br>I&#39;m done with Samsung. They have no customer service"
Ugy76ZLki0VIPRQ3zb14AaABAg,Please review the s9ultra
UgwF0h3r_ZLiq0m_lF54AaABAg,"I still see no reason to upgrade from my fold 3, so I&#39;m really hoping the z fold 6 will have a more major redesign. My pefect foldable would have a 8&quot; screen unfolded with closer to a 16:9 aspect ratio, an integrated s pen and a 5000mah battery. I would also be fine going back to a single rear camera and no cover screen camera if I coukd get a bigger battery or integrated s pen."
Ugx3YZlkHutIzwYoVq14AaABAg,they should definitely do a fold mini similar to the oppo size
Ugx_AeltGXDMIS1zWOx4AaABAg,"Sometimes i wonder what more you guys want, you basically said it&#39;s the same as last year, that statement is enough to discourage a lot of customers, then you talk about the improvements, those improvements are actually a big deal"
Ugyi7kiJWioNtVTZqSN4AaABAg,I thought they&#39;d shave off the pricing!
UgwW1Nf2K52S0Ylmhah4AaABAg,"Nice,My lock screen wallpaper and my home screen wallpapet"
Ugz0hY3gg14K3k8AbZh4AaABAg,"I was thinking of upgrading from the Fold 3 to a Fold 5, but I think I am okay for now."
Ugx4-q3udM1s0eGXOKF4AaABAg,Im upgrading to my first Fold with this ($1000 trade-in for my S22 Ultra) and the Samsung storage upgrade and credit make it worth it. Seems like the 5th gen foldable is a good place to start.
UgyEwDR6K9MFHlt5nEl4AaABAg,Could&#39;ve taken regular screen phones to a whole new level but instead degressed back into a folding phone with hella flawsüôÑ
Ugx0d5ePj8qRyFTNb5R4AaABAg,Iphones have been looking the same for the past 8 years
Ugw-QuRqsCujsMwPnHZ4AaABAg,Fold 4 is great
Ugysy72kE020gc03Ih54AaABAg,Guess im holding onto my fold3 for a bit longer
UgyPyjXoi2mVB4An_Bl4AaABAg,Poor from Samsung better folds now vivo xiaomi hauwei honor few others are improving every year ie bigger front screen 67 watt fast charger in the box also I won&#39;t be upgrading to fold 5 I&#39;ve fold 4 only reason I don&#39;t buy vivo x fold or xiaomi fold honor is u don&#39;t get notifications on time on the always on display this is only reason I&#39;m with Samsung but if others release global I&#39;m gone to them üòÇ
Ugw04fy7j46LL1MONZd4AaABAg,Welp. I&#39;m definitely getting a zfold 5 this year. Only reason I held out was due to the hinge not being dust resistant. Now it is.
Ugxo-NWMiKGH3uZyTuB4AaABAg,"i think allllll companies are settling in tbh. Apple has had the same design for years, google and samsung is also doing it. I think if it works it doesnt nneed to be changed dramatically. Obviously a big change would be nice but it is only the 5th gen so i dont think its that big of a deal. just switched to samsung after being with apple since the iphone 4 and ive seen how far they are compared to apple and its insane to me."
Ugyx22-zURROhc1HIKh4AaABAg,"Honestly, this tech screams boring.<br><br>I‚Äôd rather have an iPhone or Android with an iPad mini for the same price‚Ä¶."
UgwzqO8Z7JU4zuwMwCh4AaABAg,Apple gives mediocre updates to their phones almost every single year barely changing processor and camera and you call this the &quot;samsung way&quot; lmao
UgynKIPPBt6u3U0aTRV4AaABAg,"Thank you, MKBHD!"
UgwM5JkiDx8bwNAJd_J4AaABAg,Watch Video?
Ugy2GhRsiHpvtic-mX94AaABAg,i just got my announcement of fafsa(?) repayments but<br>once day ill be able to afford a gigantic tablet
Ugx9Chf3ks5U63gt8cl4AaABAg,"I wonder if MKBHD will say the same about the next iPhone, which will look like past four generations üòÇüòÇ. But no, apple doesn&#39;t settle as per him. Biased review."
UgwG7cNvDTZQKNqZwpR4AaABAg,I want a new note üò¢
Ugw4TtR6nIm7xcCz0b14AaABAg,Samsung tried to resemble the first folding business phones from Nokia back in a day! legendary communicators which you don&#39;t remember! I felt old! ;)
UgyJ9PoW2c2U-cqIRjd4AaABAg,Meh...
UgylmJXW8Vv0GyjpfVF4AaABAg,"I upgraded my Flip4 to Flip5 for $100, that&#39;s the only reason I&#39;m getting it. That and the outside screen."
UgwepJytjoMnvCnRSGx4AaABAg,i feel like Samsung is pulling a jeep and using the same jeep for 10 years with minor  upgrades
Ugwcmklm40mLdej6Ak14AaABAg,"I am the biggest idiot.. Brought the s23 ultra .. It was an upgrade from the note 10 . Compared to note 10 , it was so gigantic. almost useless one handed.  have to use with a carrying attachment, cause i am always afraid of dropping it....just no one at samsung looked at ppls handsizes...stupid me for not trying on to hand.."
UgzLOqnAX9FnTpKxdQ94AaABAg,Razr+ supports Ready For.<br><br>Z Flip 5 DOESN&#39;T support Samsung Dex as far as I&#39;m aware.
Ugwclb6JJW2hiMtz-z14AaABAg,For me this type of phone (fold) have no much sens with battery like this. You buying tablet phone without tablet battery. Yet lot of &quot;normal&quot; smartphones can have 5 or 6000 mha batterywith no problem.
UgxTgltSedBFwaHK5Zd4AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=6m30s"">6:30</a> Yes, it&#39;s tall but grabbable with one hand which makes it easy to reach up there with confidence, it&#39;s the other way round with S23U !"
UgxBD8wVQb5jYXs1hwZ4AaABAg,Maybe Samsung is sick of being the 1st to do anything or innovate letting others take a risk...

UgwrOcCC_2FnxFpOWBZ4AaABAg,Samsung settled? Say that every year apple introduces a new iphone every year! Give me a break bro.
UgyTMYDFxvqESxKnFDR4AaABAg,I actually kind of like Samsung&#39;s approach of releasing a lot of different types and then refining what people prefer.
UgxCk_LuuFrBbV4DWId4AaABAg,Congratulations Samsung on finally closing the horrible gap in the category they invented and everyone else does better now lol
UgwNE1CI50AIst09ciF4AaABAg,So your basically paying 1799 for a new hinge
Ugx5K-QzjHC4aNJ34vt4AaABAg,The taller aspect ratio is amazing. If i need to do something quick its perfect and it fits in my hand. Typing isnt an issue if you just use swipe. People seem to forget that the phone has two screens and if you are sending long messages or really watching content then just open the phone. The aspect ratio also means that the inside is taller rather than wider which makes it natural to use for typing as it is not unnecessary wide like with the pixel. Even now on youtube i see more of the video even with the comment section and keyboard taking up space.
UgwsG87zJ4lpR9e87vZ4AaABAg,Seeing these devices in person is truly impressive. The screen tech is amazing. Would love to see Apple give it a go with their spin.
Ugz7mg0fP4nzUXOBfi94AaABAg,Fold series gives me the nokia communicator vibes.

UgxLfYoHefXnRlUhPm94AaABAg,"I think the passport sized folding phone is the perfect form factor. Either if Samsung creates a new one or switches the fold series to that, and/or the Google Fold gets better over time, that is the one that I&#39;ll get."
UgziGDwql_ty5KHWg6B4AaABAg,Please review the new S9 tablets! Looking to get a new android tablet
Ugz-bEnPJD9VwAp44Hx4AaABAg,haters going to hate
UgyIH-H4jynAS21MGHx4AaABAg,It&#39;s a Motorola copy
Ugx7ymqlUSi6LEUKMlx4AaABAg,Maybe they had bigger things in the works and just punted for this generation. Kinda like the Apple Watch Series 7. Not enough time to swing big and also waiting for the reception of the Pixel Fold to figure out a solid strategy.<br><br>I don&#39;t think this will get Z Fold 4 users to upgrade for any other reason than failure avoidance with the folding screen. I have moved on the a Pixel Fold and it&#39;s so much more pleasant to use with the wider cover screen.
UgyHmgSHXSMI6TlZu6Z4AaABAg,Damn such newness üòÖ<br>Apple is jealous anyways üòÇüòÇ
UgzLqw86AbopA__aNoN4AaABAg,I thought they&#39;d improve the battery life a bit. It&#39;s very disappointing in my opinion
UgyzhXOpKvDdYVY_eNB4AaABAg,"hey, keep up the great work, not gonna lie your videos are amazing, just one little flaw that i have is not even with your video, but your translation, the spanish version idk if it&#39;s made with some sort of IA generated-ish kind of thing, i just don&#39;t feel it&#39;s right maybe even it&#39;s just the mic of the guy who is reading the script or something, but it just doesn&#39;t feel natural at all, i rather just hear the original audio"
UgwQovfjWgfXB_ftTF54AaABAg,Next pixel foldable should be interesting
UgyeSYh26J1sysFvIZV4AaABAg,The second hand market is full of flips and foldes and they look really bad over time.  I&#39;m still not convinced
UgwSKld32sDHLGfVedh4AaABAg,Samsung is gonna get burned on the fold 5. I have the 4 and I&#39;m not upgrading.  Infact I&#39;m looking at the pixel fold. That cover display means everything to me
UgyUbO_6r_a41xcE46d4AaABAg,i think if you have a flip or fold 3 then its worth the upgrade but not from the 4 they hopefully will have a pen slot on the next one or maybe the 7 currious if the new pen will work on the 4 and if the same form factor do the fold 5 cases fit the 4?
Ugz1jh0MeickaZpFJR54AaABAg,"Too expensive for what it is nowadays... Battery life is too low for that big screen. The front camera is of lower quality. And, if I&#39;m not wrong, there&#39;s no MicroSD slot... Absolutely seeing no point in this phone at this price point. Maybe at around 1300 max. <br>The prices of phones need to drop down, for real.<br>I&#39;m still using Note 10+ with total of 1TB of storage, 12gb of ram and 4300mah and what am I getting from the newest phones is not enough to justify the price difference. <br>Only at this new gen actually (S23 Ultra) I can finally get that much better snapdragon CPU, but same RAM (it should be at least 16gb though), no microSD, more battery capacity (in combo with that CPU means better battery life), and other improvements. And still, to pay 1000eur on top of my current phone to get those, doesn&#39;t seem justified...<br>Phones need to calm the prices down, in Floss words..."
UgyCkrdDTFc18vCiS0B4AaABAg,Lazy engineering. I expected more on fold 5
UgxKNVfaUq6ociiJc8N4AaABAg,Tha nyjah Huston of techüî•
UgzH2tOIjR6NDHm8po54AaABAg,So let me get that straight - no meaningful upgrades and they still keep it at $1800? Samsung is becoming a joke

UgwwpHw1T9M5IF_8MhF4AaABAg,"I still can‚Äôt understand foldable phones. What are other advantages of having a foldable (or the form factor of a foldable phone) besides more screen? And why more screen?<br><br>Does foldables have better camera, screen, battery?<br><br>Maybe they didn‚Äôt settled. Maybe the foldable form factor just don‚Äôt make too much sense anymore. And now that we have good foldable phones we can see that."
UgxPIPvptAj95BgV5EZ4AaABAg,"I&#39;m looking to replace my Fold 2 after 2,5 years of happy use, but Samsung is not giving me much reason to upgrade (and spend over a 1000 euro to do so)<br><br>Therefore I&#39;m eagerly awaiting to experience what the OnePlus foldable and Honor Magic V2 look like in real life. Chinese phones seem to improve in bigger steps (in terms of hardware)<br><br>I&#39;d be very interested in a double folding phone too. Would be nice if Samsung made a true Z-folding phone that unfolds to a 10 inch tablet."
UgyamQC4vfKZVoPErOV4AaABAg,"Please ellaborate on the updated hinge. When I tried the fold and flip 5, it was extremely stiff and not something to be opened and closed with one hand."
Ugz-q9kb6d96TNR6MsR4AaABAg,"I&#39;m calling it, in 2030 we are going to have The Fold, Fold+ and Fold Ultra."
UgzHI4YEL7Kc-7vBUyl4AaABAg,"all we&#39;ve been hearing about is the iPhone staying the same, but the android boys aren&#39;t saying anything about this??? okay okay"
UgzJlq1wSzzp8FTWKAN4AaABAg,"In the Netherlands, we have a law for this: the law of the handicap of a head start (original Dutch: Wet van de remmerend voorsprong). The law suggests that making progress in a particular area often creates circumstances in which stimuli are lacking to strive for further progress. This results in the individual or group that started out ahead eventually being overtaken by others."

UgwZUOi7Cpv1qqFjefR4AaABAg,"Wow.. Z Fold looks like a refined version of previous generation.<br>This time it looks like it can replace a tablet and a smartphone.<br>Amount of real estate on the folding screen is insane. I hope this new hinge also fixes durability issues, because, lets be honest, Samsung foldable displays durability is(was?) no rival to the ones used in Motorola devices."
Ugw_Otcz39WzMwv1sxh4AaABAg,"Sad that the front of the flip only uses widgets, instead of apps."
UgwVjpdfoKp1e1i1mkh4AaABAg,The bezel is back! Dope I still have my galaxy watch 4 cause I hated just the flat top.
Ugz2iJhlQoUVew4Ra8l4AaABAg,Man.. what a let down tbh. I traded in my Fold 3 for the S23U cause the front screen on the Fold 3 was too small. Then the Fold 4 came out with a bigger front screen but I thought.. nah not big enough and was hoping they&#39;ll increase the size on the Fold 5. A part of me is glad they didn&#39;t because then I&#39;d be on the fence about trading in my S23U which I love. So easy skip for me.
UgzR88je9sWTEek8CIR4AaABAg,Didn&#39;t Samsung get rid of the letter Z?
UgxSA3phqOHHkPmI1gl4AaABAg,Over a year now and my fold 4 is still in immaculate condition  im a grease monkey by day so this phone gets dropped and covered in oils and chemicals everyday a good otter or amazon  case no problem hereüëç

UgzLSJyylVrE58hCz754AaABAg,"Thanks for the update Marques, sad to see that there wasnt really any changes to the screen and bump it has but at least the hinge is getting better. I want a fold but it seems like Ill have to wait another 2 versions before Ill get it. Great vid."

Ugzi6R9lNS7QoVJoRCl4AaABAg,I love my flip 4 and might upgrade to the flip5 if they give me a decent trade in amount.
UgygA9YW08pptN4Lj254AaABAg,"In Germany the price of the Fold 5 has increased, the trade-in prices are terrible and generally the Fold 5 doesn&#39;t look like a valuable step up from the Fold 3. After 13 years of Samsung it might be time for me to have a oook around..."
UgzaefTyEEf66XUSkx14AaABAg,Spanish track? Heck yeah
UgygQfBLE4zQ4VVOrC54AaABAg,It&#39;s not the &quot;Samsung way&quot;. Samsung use to be leaders and innovators in the mobile phone industry. It&#39;s the Apple way to keep releasing the same phone with no real upgrades. I guess Samsung is happy copying apples way.
UgzE1WCkkcBl5pOmAPd4AaABAg,Iphone will make the same looking phone 3 years in a row.....
Ugy9mtPPI356PNo3yWF4AaABAg,‚úå
UgxZ0IJMpsvF2hrTDVB4AaABAg,"4 years after I stil don&#39;t understand what there&#39;s a punch hole camera in the front display (The smaller one) on the Z Fold 5. Really, If you need to take selfie, use the main sensor on the back. If you need to have video call, you&#39;ve the underdisplay camera in the 7,6&quot; screen. <br>So yes, this hole punch doesn&#39;t make sens, this is thing add cost to Samsung (probably not a lot tbh) and we don&#39;t have a really full screen."
UgwLSSBvTK2Yg3kohXV4AaABAg,"Charging $1800 for what is basically an identical phone to last year is pretty lame.<br><br>I won&#39;t ever buy a folding phone anyways. But if the phone is basically identical to last year, drop the price $100 or so"

UgyYuGAKDeK0Q4gD1Oh4AaABAg,Meh  the Motorola has it down with the flip...The good news is that now the Motorola will now be found cheaper...So i&#39;ll get the moto instead.
Ugx0aWzPGljGYNKrkGZ4AaABAg,"Samsung is the king in designing phones and yah for sure you&#39;re honest Marques üòä , force Samsung to design a new phone cause every other phone manufacturer company will fall in. Samsung phones are superior and advanced in every way there even durable."
UgzCaFPnpOm62KGNTe54AaABAg,"I don&#39;t get it, why did they release these first folding phones? and why not just wait until they have come up with a way to perfect it. Its almost like they are releasing a bad version of this phone, and earn some off of that, just to later release a better version. imagine how fooled you must feel when you sign up for a 3 year contract to pay one of the lesser versions off. I suppose i will give it maybe two more years or so before i buy one of these or when they find a way to make that crease go away."
UgzjO0MAlsRFjVKfJhN4AaABAg,"Looks like in a couple years I will likely switch to the Fold. I like the concept, but wanted to wait u til it was finalized and the major bugs with the hardware have been worked out. I&#39;ve currently got an S22 Ultra and it will last me a few more years."
UgzLI4BLA1MlM-rLbOR4AaABAg,For $1800 usd you could literally get a tab s8 ultra and s22... Insane these prices for the fold 5
UgwwnLVzgxotTT_LS1h4AaABAg,"Im pretty sure i prefer the narrow form factor. I don&#39;t own one but I&#39;ve done a lot of testing with the fold 4 and any other folding phone i can get my hands on. <br><br>Makes one handed operation SO MUCH better. <br><br>And if I&#39;m going to use two hands, I&#39;m going to use the big screen, which is the entire reason i want a s folding phone to begin with. <br><br>I currently use an lgv60 with the dual screen case so i am required to &quot;unfold&quot; every single time i use my phone. So i know i wont habe a problem with unfolding very often."
Ugz_21bW-aMyULMCbKx4AaABAg,cool flip phones
UgzGwNlaHXMbmjDuH9B4AaABAg,"Well.. I&#39;m over here going, &quot;Damn, you slacking Samsung, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll win me over again this year. &quot;... as I watch this on a S20FE knowing that this is the best phone I&#39;ve personally owned and knowing it&#39;s probably 70%-80% of what the S20Ultra was, let alone the S23Ultra and Fold 4.üòÇüòÇ"

UgzwkJ6-eKwmnGKL_Mt4AaABAg,"Oh boy, my experience with the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3! It was like living in a never-ending nightmare, and even just hearing its name now sends shivers down my spine. üòÇ"
UgxFFrKWmflmikU7TPB4AaABAg,I guess I&#39;ll keep my ZF3 for a little while longer
UgyfzzPJkQsFUuHVNhB4AaABAg,I‚Äôm saying it now but the camera design that‚Äôs on the Fold 5 will be on the Galaxy S24
UgzwYRsF-56VjJT9HFp4AaABAg,"Just a reminder, just about 10 years ago we were looking at the Galaxy S2 and here we are, 10 years later."
Ugxjwad_dYpXrI74nOp4AaABAg,Theyre so polished im considering a fold now
UgxevbI-3fX1mFdi3Ch4AaABAg,I feel like samsung keeping it safe is a good üëç
UgyRLgOwucfKWP0D0ft4AaABAg,"Also, the narrow screen is the best. It is so nice to hold in the hand. I was getting tired of how wide phones were but now I get to both Best of Both Worlds. Narrow on the outside and easy to hold and then a nice big screen on the inside. Actually one of my favourite features of this phone is that it&#39;s narrow so I hope Samsung never listens to any of you guys online and makes it wider. Buy an s23 or an iPhone if you want a wide phone. The nice thing that Samsung does is try to make different things."
UgxELwVKptH8vjZJS7R4AaABAg,"If they&#39;re coming with the same battery, then is it safe to say that Flip5 will get shorter battery life than Flip4 cuz they got bigger screen at the back? If it is, it would be a bummer"
Ugy-h-OwymARIBwykjt4AaABAg,The price of the fold is what keeps me away. That‚Äôs crazy amount for<br>a phone.
Ugxr05zCaGQOitlDA354AaABAg,"I still have my fold 2, but i barely switch to a s23. I feel like if I go back to a fold lineup I&#39;ll be happy with my 2. Overall I&#39;m digging the flip 5 &amp; trading in my fold 2 is tempting."
UgwJtkTYCoSydJlLRJd4AaABAg,So what you&#39;re saying is they&#39;re doing what Apple does. Small incremental changes. Yet somehow iPhones every year seems to be nearly perfect to you and when Samsung does the same thing you&#39;re like all they barely changed anything.
Ugzru9ERb9vhXBiZy2R4AaABAg,Insent a new chip a huge upgrade??
UgzmGrjom7uCc6WUxxJ4AaABAg,Samsung is doing what apple has been doing for years. Small iterations and minimal design change.
Ugx40-nzv2tXWYYxywV4AaABAg,Defo keep my flip 4 another year see what they do next year
Ugz2RzFlZZyd1zKLwyt4AaABAg,I&#39;ll never get the weird narrow form factor. I would absolutely love a pixel fold and am dying to get one (it it wasn&#39;t for the price) but I just really can&#39;t imagine having a Samsung fold because of the screen ratio
UgwdR_6jDczZkCJs0wh4AaABAg,Until they add a integrated spen in the z fold I&#39;m not upgrading to it yet.
UgyV3ImytXJOpRioVN94AaABAg,"To be fair, there‚Äôs really not much that you could improve on when it comes to Samsung foldables. They‚Äôre so good and so ahead of the competition that you could understand why there‚Äôs not much changes from the previous generation."
UgykGqCIQUmKl45m1DR4AaABAg,I agree completely! A more Pixel Fold shape would encourage me to buy the Fold 5. I have the Fold 3 and a Pixel 7 Pro and enjoy the Pixel a lot more.

Ugw-k4XbWrnpXJY12Ix4AaABAg,Great. Now i can update my fold 3 to brand new fold 4 for much less money :)
Ugzix0t5wJrLWpmWbRB4AaABAg,Samsung with the incremental &quot;Apple&quot; upgrades. Ridiculous. Phones have gotten stale and boring. They should&#39;ve reduced the Fold&#39;s price since its basically the same.
UgyESBdvkdLxD4ygCIx4AaABAg,"Samsung is resting on their laurels. If they dont start innovating again. Google and other phone manufacturers will pass them up, in the foldable phone markets."
UgyJ7D2FU31N07R6gOZ4AaABAg,"What really pisses me off, is that it&#39;s still just using 25W charging. And I&#39;m not going to call it Super Fast Charging because it&#39;s not fast anymore.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
UgzGaDKjSLGi_k7GW494AaABAg,Samsung settles under Roh
UgxL9ttxIap2CzBy4wh4AaABAg,"I just put my hands on z fold 5 at my local Bestbuy and it is Lighter in weight and the screen gets brighter and the crease was DEFINITELY LESS NOTICEABLE,  U can almost not see it or feel it... and could not see or tell the inner screen protector was there... this is compared to my z fold4..<br>I&#39;m actually impressed about the crease being less noticeable..üòÆüòÅüëçWOW.."
Ugzmf1piNwyHnc7UkMN4AaABAg,"I hate non-daily users&#39; opinions on Foldable&#39;s form factor. I&#39;ve daily a fold 3 for the past 2 years, I saw and tried the Pixel Fold. Having a wider but shorter screen is NOT the experience that I, or anyone that I&#39;ve talked to that own it. Black bars on top and bottom in scenarios were the apps are not adapted to it; whereas in the Fold, it stretches out and looks good, cause it&#39;s just two regular phones slap together so the aspect ratio makes sense. We don&#39;t use the outside screen that much, and when we do, it&#39;s convenient that it&#39;s narrow. Oppo Find N and Pixel Fold form factors are going to be for niche users. Stop complaining about things the actual buyers and keepers of the phone don&#39;t want."
UgwSqx5UQlDL160usAl4AaABAg,"My whole purchase decision was based around whether or not the s-pen could be stored in the fold. Sadly, I will not be upgrading this year. They are sitting on DIAMONDS. If they could just figure out a way to fit the s-pen in there, I am certain a lot more people would buy it."
Ugzqc17_pCdL6KM7YVF4AaABAg,Gotta have the integrated S pen and cameras matching the s2X ultra before I&#39;d consider spending $2k on the fold.
UgywvqafbupHHkn00-h4AaABAg,"They settle for now, because currently, not much good foldable competition is here. Once it does, Samsung will have no choice but to significantly upgrade the Fold series as well."
UgwcLt5dxqWS2q2cPCZ4AaABAg,I can&#39;t wait to get this

UgxpCH1ak1XLrLq2uht4AaABAg,So Question. Is it a good upgrade from flip4 to the flip5? Or should I just wait for a later model?
Ugx1c-CggqsgDGg2e3l4AaABAg,After only previous iterations I highly do not recommend this phone.
Ugz3Jxq9CHWS2gRGaTJ4AaABAg,Galaxy Watch 6 is also meh. Next year!
UgwMzvTXxQlmQkfD8l54AaABAg,I can&#39;t understand why these phones exist?! it&#39;s obviously an uncmpleted and not practical concept.

Ugx2cclDgXcNygwx3qF4AaABAg,Too all üçé loyalists. Stop whining about Samsung phone lack or needs 2 improve on Galaxy phone lines. So  Cupertino üçé nerds came up 2 make foldable phones?

UgyEkkRnvSWaaTIrDed4AaABAg,"I&#39;m telling you after awhile it just won&#39;t be worth upgrading your phone until the company completely messes it up all these phones are the same, a little faster and upgrading the camera is all they do"
UgzS6_CapUJSUfjpabx4AaABAg,Same old ü§∑
UgyQCvMTFHKMeOQ-a694AaABAg,Following Apple&#39;s Footsteps I Guess üòÇ
UgyJGAjGQeecK9dHQAl4AaABAg,Galaxy mega was where its at back in day
UgxC_SSgiKhY3YTIGUx4AaABAg,"I see virtually no benefit to owning a flip phone, but for some reason I kind of want one.<br>I suppose what actually want a &#39;fold&#39; phone, but the prices for them are still so insane that I&#39;d never touch it."
UgxqECiPrJnRs2z0rkF4AaABAg,"Damn, do they have a sale on last year&#39;s model? If so I can get that and save money"
Ugxt6hHDFFo8yxR-sYF4AaABAg,so it‚Äôs basically same shit :))
UgydJgq_hBDEZffJO6J4AaABAg,Why 30fps and not 60?
Ugwx0liFyND74YUTJfp4AaABAg,"That new Z Flip looks really nice, and I&#39;d certainly enjoy the extra pocket space, but I&#39;m gonna wait for the iPhone 15 Pro and then make a decision."
UgzHj1vSIugIOzX8W914AaABAg,Samsung needs to add an SD CARD SLOT every th ok mg else is good
Ugz_2YZqPpFnx8hLdz14AaABAg,"If Apple made a foldable, I would wait in line overnight like it‚Äôs 2009"
UgxdGgEZYIsnsLdvjc54AaABAg,they just made a phone just to make one. where is the innovation..
UgwG08mbGx7FdxPgBr14AaABAg,So that means the Pixel Fold is by far better
UgyDeJTpgge71yYpehZ4AaABAg,I think this is a rare miss by MKBHD. The outer screen and the new hinge make this a very different phone than last generation
Ugy-4oVqqWX2sLKNSmJ4AaABAg,"Suena horrible en espa√±ol, que demonios pasa?"
UgygwOgWaRXFu3iP8Ix4AaABAg,Very disappointed they still havent widened the front screen on the fold. Yet another year i pass on an upgrade. Still rocking the S20+
UgyYSuHS1J96all5rFh4AaABAg,Dont buy the new Razrs. They dont support security software upgrades. I bought the razr 5g and it&#39;s still stuck on android 12. That was there most expensive phone and no upgrades. Ridiculous.
Ugwc2IUA9mftJ8_LDyB4AaABAg,"Zzzzzzz, great video tho."
UgzK84UKIwbp_zUh2Gd4AaABAg,"Do these phones (like any other android) still happen to sh1t on videos and pic‚Äôs whenever you upload them into social media apps? Man, that‚Äôs the main problem I used to have when using androids and the main reason too why I started using iPhones."
Ugz1XI0_8698TTq6_yd4AaABAg,Seems to me Samsung was not expecting the competition to hot up and only Google is a real competitor because you can&#39;t buy the rest outside of China. Mostly.
UgwTSYegTlTc8xfK1UV4AaABAg,Apple been doing all this incremental upgrades and people are calling them as revolution... SMH
UgxOUNxtu_AGMafjq_p4AaABAg,"If they make it essentially the same as the S23 Ultra, with the external screen size matching, battery size, s pen storage, and fix the crease, I&#39;ll buy one immediately.  But, the thing most these companies mess up is... They experiment with cheap garbage that nobody wants, and then decide that nobody wants it, so they stop developing.  They never experiment with good hardware.  Thinking back, there have been so many cool experimental devices over the years that I&#39;ve genuinely wanted until I looked up the specs.  Then they assume nobody wants it because nobody purchased the garbage version üôÑ Like back in the day a few companies made a mobile gaming device that happened to be a phone, but none of them could compete with the PSP... If they would have stepped it up and made a PSP phone, with online gaming... Could&#39;ve been HUGE.  But, instead, they made a Nokia with extra buttons, and then assumed nobody was interested."
UgydGQrf4ouA3f4zuoB4AaABAg,So I glad I skipped the 4 and kept with my 3 because these changes will be new to me.
UgzSYlRumK_AxhXXsR94AaABAg,"Winner. I&#39;ve had so many different phones. But the fold narrow ratio by far the best, I have the 4 and I will trade it in for the 5. Screen ratio so much more easier and personally practical when it comes to one-handed use as I found myself throughout the years naturally one handed texting etc 80%+ of the time. No phone has felt natural doing so till the Galaxy fold. But unfortunately and like what he was talking about is I think people take the screen size of per say that iPhone and have that the new normal in their head (can&#39;t remember how many times I was in bed or cert positions or walking and try to one hand and failed or just stretch my thumb and had to whip out my other hand). Honestly it makes me think of the same situation but the way around, imagine all phones with this ratio. Then they create a phone with an iPhone ratio. People with the iPhone ratio would be complaining left and right that they would have to use two hands to send a text or dial. <br>But there were a few things I was hoping for on the 5. The crease to be gone totally, not a big deal but been nice. Thinner and lighter, but  haven&#39;t held the 5 yet. Footnote- something I thought of but I knew that they wouldn&#39;t do or expect them to - be really cool, to make Bixby a super powerful AI..."
Ugxy20z0oT0IpiRwA0p4AaABAg,"My Flip3 had it&#39;s screen crack at the hinge after 11 months. Was fixed under warrantee. But now at 22 months it starts cracking again and the battery drains to 20% before <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=14m00s"">14:00</a> whil I took it of the charger at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=9m00s"">9:00</a>.. Very disapointed in this technology and hearing that Samsung did not change anything about that creese is even more disapointing. Used Samsung phones for more then 10 years now but this is my last Samsung phone."
UgyV_ui7ji02CyBsiiF4AaABAg,‚Ä¶ i kinda liked the small outside screen in the fold.
Ugxa038V2j6yW04zbel4AaABAg,I think the reasons you stated of how you feel about the outer Zfold 5 narrow screen is exactly why its like that - imo likely to push you to open up the phone more instead of use it like a conventional one
Ugzx19Vw9mwPzzgLXm54AaABAg,What&#39;s the point of folding phones? I just don&#39;t get it.
Ugx1vbBxv9TmjRG9GLJ4AaABAg,"Folds are still too expensive, not durable enough, flips I still don‚Äôt see the point."
UgwlDw2RYdL19G7hmtN4AaABAg,"Iphone 4/5s+ Android screen size=Flip 5. In thr future, Flip will be the portable Camera beast. May replace the Series which combi of Note series. While Fold phone will be the most Portable Phone/Note/tablet in the future."

UgxNrX9jJJ6wU-l9UNt4AaABAg,"If it has enough differences / new things to justify a review, I&#39;d really like to see a video on the new S9 Ultra üôè"
UgwaBz27ZJmi41xxXot4AaABAg,So all the rumours of less of a crease are false?
UgyPMa89PKj3trDAUMh4AaABAg,I don&#39;t understand why Samsung doesn&#39;t make the outside display 6.8+ inches....and thus a bigger inside display.
UgygxnGK7kSjbS4x-pB4AaABAg,Are you getting some sleep mann? 2 high quality vids separated by 24hrs
UgxIl1rB-RXKqSxj_6t4AaABAg,"It sounds like if it was Apple instead of Samsung, MKBHD would have been like - -- that&#39;s a BIG change....!"
UgzqndjwKBGLmTC1-q14AaABAg,The SDG2 chip on the Flip 5 will definitely be a big help in terms of battery life.
UgxKyBv30IqMqpxGkEF4AaABAg,Foldables are dumb. And nobody buys them except YouTube reviewers. Change my mind.
UgzfdYVVvc7DA_xMHWZ4AaABAg,"In the words of Floss Carter...&quot;Z fold 5 is an update, not an upgrade&quot;"
UgzS-RObufOC2o7IcXl4AaABAg,"i still struggle to care about these phones. the whole thing seems kind of pointless? it‚Äôs all, just meh"
UgyR1ABmAcC2GwhsNMx4AaABAg,Flip phones are largely pointless.
Ugyj7ltrtU-aVAoRccZ4AaABAg,The fact that the smaller outside screen is the same size as the iphone 4 screen is mind blowing
UgywubwqbLA_tBhZ8694AaABAg,Cannot wait for Apple to move into this territory.
Ugzc11S6PtcSmYNBTuR4AaABAg,the phone that no one will buy . if someone bought it. he will regret
UgyTGLNp-JcgqLTe8_94AaABAg,I have a question ‚ÅâÔ∏è why we need two display for Big Fold when SAMSUNG or other brand can skip the Front display and thus can make phone thinner better. Actually inner display is a tablet size is I guess company wanted to achieve by bringing flexible display Right??
UgwQK3Ws0X3Vdczo9L94AaABAg,ill keep my Xiaomi  fold 2
UgxCM7zXPlpSzvdNCT94AaABAg,I was hoping to see bigger changes to the ZFOLD 5 before trading in my ZFOLD 4 for the S23 ULTRA.
Ugw6xg1R8DKGezu_sl54AaABAg,"Cmon man,<br><br>When Apple changes very little about an iPhone you still praise the phone. <br><br>Yet when Samsung does it you take issue.<br><br>Why the inconsistency?"

UgxPn1pi-S8W4SOE5954AaABAg,"so I&#39;m sticking with my fold 3, I can&#39;t find a reason to upgrade"
Ugxz--B-eKr4J61LxLl4AaABAg,"Since rumors of the Fold 6 are that it will be a significant design change. I think they feel the fire under their butts from Pixel, Oneplus, maybe even surface? Im definately waiting till next year to upgrade my fold 3 since the fold 5 is basicly the same. Too bad theres so much wrong with pixel cause that form factor is perfect."
UgyQGgqtsLMJtP9YE3N4AaABAg,Samsung is getting lazy in my opinion.
Ugy635uwkJlAHbOIMXd4AaABAg,"My man playing iphone videos on youtube and watching them on samsung, what a digüòÇ"
UgwT4EoAzBd5MANh7yl4AaABAg,"So keep my z fold 3, got it."
UgxG2TD-PQ2cFhfFNXd4AaABAg,It&#39;s insane how it took us 5 generations for the folding phones to be able to fold completely flat.
UgyOlPUHipr9_ej2LR94AaABAg,zfold throw it away somewhere
UgxgZ1aNjyp3iwwfOo94AaABAg,It&#39;s really cool how Samsung settles in designing smartphones and making them better in their subsequent release of new phones instead of transitioning to different  designs. This would give us an insight of what they doing better than they did in previous designs.
UgwqvpwKSkOXflmk64B4AaABAg,I already said if they didn&#39;t upgrade the camera and upgrade the pen nor the crease then what would be the point of upgrading looks like ill have to wait till they wow me again. Overall the fold is still solid
Ugz3BLvdKZji6RfQ_iF4AaABAg,"The foldables cost way too much to be a mainstream product. So they will iterate on this tiny market. If they get cheap enough they might become popular, but for the foreseeable future it will remain a niche product. Not sure how Corning is making this Victus glass. seems miraculous."
Ugzwzo9VkbdiV7N-Wst4AaABAg,Huge let down for fold 5 . Sad to see samsung become iphone

UgwhYP2ld_xVep2hWSB4AaABAg,"It&#39;s funny to me how they&#39;re asking ultra premium prices for these devices just for the novelty of folding the phone and they still have subpar camera hardware. It&#39;s even more ridiculous that they didn&#39;t even bother upgrading them from the Fold 4 to the Fold 5.<br><br>Oh and also, I&#39;m here hoping one day those monster tablets will actually replace computers for a lot of people."

UgzqWwr_fswvBTBY1nR4AaABAg,"I already think that regular cell phones are too tall and narrow ... I don&#39;t even need to comment on what I think about the fold. What I really want and need now is a cell phone with a single screen, but very wide, like a surface duo (but without the second screen)."

UgzAaRiTaZtDDo_QSr94AaABAg,What stops me from trying one is the lack of dust resistance. As my daily driver it needs to be able to handle a trip to a beach just as well as a day in an office without me feeling guilty about being reckless with my precious phone.
UgzOe4qIxAcFZ8AYPB94AaABAg,How does this compare to the Google Fold?
UgxMAsmcjXhzqgdoIpZ4AaABAg,"Gotta love it when reviewers completely ignore and don&#39;t call Apple out for making the same exact phone for YEARS, but are super quick to call out other companies, like Samsung, when they do similarly."

UgzCwOesled9dfQ11zR4AaABAg,"I think this&#39;s because Apple, Apple is doing this to their phones and they kind of doing the exact same thing <br>1. Apple is not on the foldable section yet <br>2. Apple has the biggest consumers and the ecosystem. They affect the other competitors so much; this problem is huge to others and they have to step down and make their own ecosystem by not giving too many hardware updates. <br>3. So much stuff happens due to Apple, maybe the next only competitors might be Apple and Google"

Ugz4tDTZwJrwGV89AdJ4AaABAg,"You know society is spoiled when faster processing, longer batter life, weighs less, folds flatter and is physically flatter, has faster storage memory with UFS, gets camera glass upgrades, brighter screen, 40% slimmer pen just isn&#39;t enough. Some would have liked a slightly wider cover screen. Sure no crease would have been nice.<br><br>The reality is most people are not on foldable phones so refining what was a very good phone is exactly what&#39;s needed to get more people over to this category while truly disruptive screen technologies are commercialized."

UgyTBRdyla3tV8WCy6x4AaABAg,I love how Samsung has settled but Apple hasn&#39;t. Apple has had the same design for years and used the same hardware for years until recently. But again they haven&#39;t settled?
UgyfW_lyS97fVTICDsl4AaABAg,i was a guinea pig buying the fold1 for ¬£2k. I&#39;m still waiting for a wow moment because these upgrades/changes all look incremental
UgxFgGxqBcdJd_Qww0R4AaABAg,Cool!‚úåÔ∏è
UgxiyYGx8Ile3y0s60p4AaABAg,"Great review man... I&#39;m just waiting on the stylus into the phone like the galaxy note.<br>It&#39;s the 5th generation, I&#39;m not carrying a external stylus pen. Rediculous"
UgxG1jp6J--uSD5r2iN4AaABAg,Everyone is okay with iphone looking exactly the same for past half decade now?
UgxhhetTPxSsUfq72L54AaABAg,"Ugh, what happened to you, samsung!"

Ugw2xw2CdC57KWN_yFB4AaABAg,"So Samsung closed 1mm gap, but did not add the s-pen slot forcing me to add 12mm of extra case space... Plain ridiculous. Sticking to my Fold 3 waiting for 6... or a competitor"
Ugwz8ak-L5XgTfWjWBJ4AaABAg,‚ÄúSame rubbish‚Äù ‚Äúsame easily breakable screen that they refuse to fix under warranty‚Äù
Ugy3o3Fa3Bt0VBM5uyZ4AaABAg,Big bag of meh
Ugyk708FJoIHoYIdOD94AaABAg,"I hope they fixed the hinge issue with the Flip 4. You can literally drop it not even a 2 inches and the thing jams up and breaks. Other than that, I love the phones design."
UgxYtp-ZGY_VEQsFmuV4AaABAg,Samsung seriously needs to find out a way to bend an actual glass display. It still feels like plastic that gives in too easy. üíØ
UgwriU09N-mWNudbgV94AaABAg,Hi I&#39;m a big time fan! Currently have the fold 3. Do I upgrade to fold 5?! My main issues are battery life and cameras. What shall I do?
Ugyy7qtOsWs8V5_Sx3x4AaABAg,"Folds are great. Love mine! Wish they&#39;d actually taken Google&#39;s Pixel Fold idea and made it open like a book to a wider-than-tall mode. Saves 1 step of rotating to get it on Z Folds. As a bonus, you get a wider front screen. Wide phones are necessary to be able to type properly. Most phones are not wide enough. If you mistype, it&#39;s because they can&#39;t make out which letter you hit. Blame narrow phones. Phones should be wider. Wider.<br><br>All right I think I made my point. :) Have a good one."
Ugy5AcQXYhsTAcfgxb14AaABAg,Wow
UgwZH9s19Ekx5e6W8Ux4AaABAg,So they&#39;re making Flip 4S and Fold 4S
Ugyj6WeyOPHnNo8FYwd4AaABAg,And people want to say that Apple makes the same thing. Doesn‚Äôt android phones do that too
UgyELwxTYnnfoH8GJ2Z4AaABAg,They need to make a passport size and really go in adding features to compete!
UgzuyG-rgt62oqUYHnx4AaABAg,Im waiting for a trifold from Samsung.
UgwNO8VervTKueHyz_V4AaABAg,They could have made the battery bigger?
UgymrupMKvVC_Tb_cPR4AaABAg,"‚ÄúiT wIlL gEt ChEaPeR ovER TiMe‚Äù they say, while 4 generations later the price on the fold is still the same, while not updating the camera or fixing the crease at all. Folding phone is such a dumb idea, all it accomplished is the ability to half its footprint in you pocket, while being inferior in everything else."
UgzKM_DemZWDVS0-oUp4AaABAg,The Motorola Razr Plus is the best flip phone out there. Period. The fact that you CANNOT open Google apps on the outer screen of the new Flip 5 makes it useless as a flip phone. I can literally open a hundred google/android apps on my Razr outer screen. Shame on you Samsung you have billions more in resources and R&amp;D and yet you cannot compete with little old Motorola...... Wasted Opportunity
Ugz-SE4K2IeStauvhJd4AaABAg,Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this is the last year for that Fold form factor. I can&#39;t imagine how much less it is to manufacture than the 3 was.
Ugz8WNHSOrdczxhOoo54AaABAg,hi Marques. what do you use to keep your tech clean? just got my new midnight MacBook Air and the fingerprints are driving me crazyü§£ is the apple cloth the way to go?üòÑ
Ugzg29hpZdhdBlKlmXl4AaABAg,Worst design for Z Flip 5. The cut-out looks weird.
Ugw0sO7g4MnvpgR03BF4AaABAg,"Everyone who is gonna buy this, is going to regret"
UgyaDZwc3t6GaGgqqdJ4AaABAg,"With all due respect, Chelsea‚Ä¶"
UgzLMmAzCA84Of_8yHt4AaABAg,"WHILE I agree for the Fold 5, as a Z Flip 4 owner, I must disagree about the Z Flip 5.. Being able to text and browse thus interact more with the front screen is a BIG DEAL that I find lacking on my Z Flip 4  ! <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>So really excited about this new iteration <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>"
UgyBKK2SqLzcARcwSvN4AaABAg,I personally like the tall outer display better than the passport shape because its easy to grip with one hand and perform functions. The whole point is the customer should be able to perform functions using just one hand and then if they want more they can just open it wide. I don&#39;t like the Pixel Fold form factor.üòä
Ugz_3iVrzcgQt5maSKN4AaABAg,Sadly smashed my z fold 3 a year ago which I i absolutely loved. Had to use poco f3 for that time and now I&#39;m due for upgrade and was looking forward to fold 5 but I cannot see that many advantages. Biggest feature being new flat folding mechanism... Really??
UgxizFVQamBTXEPC8U54AaABAg,If you can&#39;t get rid of the crease......Stop making Folds.....!!!!!
UgwLA6BcASCYA875j1t4AaABAg,Don‚Äôt know if I can justify leaving iPhone for this
UgzYXSC5HSXxy26hfHZ4AaABAg,"Samsung is doing what Apple been doing for years, they settled."
Ugzjbn8wDjPVp_xTC2V4AaABAg,I really like the form factor of the Fold 4 and I&#39;m glad they were able to keep it and was able to close the gap on the hinge. I may upgrade it from the Fold 4.
UgzrEk3rjN5quvJDtpV4AaABAg,I really want to upgrade to flip
UgzSB9sMrN4O4wG8yHd4AaABAg,Man I love them so much
Ugw7AtEnztXQkcdPSzN4AaABAg,Samsung is starving us into buying the next major product from them. It&#39;s almost like they know we want the Spen inside the fold with a wider outside screen and other features.
Ugxt3YAz1UWZczMOUNx4AaABAg,"They could have made the outside display wider on the Fold 5 and be the perfect foldable. But that display is just to narrow/small to be enjoyable and it makes you want to use the inside display, which is impossible tu use with one hand."
UgwEuLOuUqVLoLi7A2Z4AaABAg,"Both great phones, it&#39;s just to bad that they&#39;ve so overpriced.. Amazing what you pay for a feature rich phone these days. How young people can afford to pay these prices is beyond me.. What&#39;s worse is to see how willing they are to accept such debt.."
UgwwteKorayx1_dba7l4AaABAg,Ive told you 1000 times. You will have improvements in fold7. 2 generations ahead. Always.
UgzLicDr9WuI6W7q8CZ4AaABAg,The fold is cool ima get it for the large display unfolded. However the Z flip is the most useless thing I‚Äôve ever seen invented üòÇ
Ugz1WWdeP-kfbAs_9wt4AaABAg,"Why his shirt üëï shows 24 30 60 , but 24 and 60 are crossed?"
Ugy4YJlpuFgiyROxLrt4AaABAg,The Note edge will forever be my goat!!!
UgxU2LpiEPPuGUVOMfJ4AaABAg,This is hilarious. Apple ‚Äúplayed it safe‚Äùfor many years now only making internal upgrades and gets mocked for it. Now Samsung is doing the same thing and its fine and dandy? And this is coming from a Samsung user myself. üëÄ
Ugw5YLmn2TmjTtNfAEF4AaABAg,Do you think they are saving the development cycles for the next-gen product???
UgzwPj73x9xAzQrh4Yl4AaABAg,So keep my fold 4. Got it üëç
UgzPsBPBv4aJcxh-wYZ4AaABAg,"Its weird that they nailed the flip, the flip is great, but the fold is the WORST designed foldable in the entire foldables market"
Ugybeaf-mH_wjX806Xd4AaABAg,I hope the Honor Magic V2 makes it to the American market. Samsung needs a kick in the pants and I think Honor is the company to do it. No HTC or LG to really push them. I&#39;ve been holding out buying a Fold until they put a built-in S Pen. Mark V and still waiting.
UgxljIGq_fwnMT2GB8p4AaABAg,But how much innovation can they give every year. Look at iPhone they barely change the phone and their tech. Then why so much shade and pressure on Samsung and other smartphone companies?
UgwrZI06L-Y-_qUq1tR4AaABAg,"Glad to see the progress they are making, i like it. But cant motivate changing form factor from my S23 Ultra...it&#39;s just too good."
Ugzoftskg6Qt5AkUu7R4AaABAg,Anyone remember that conceptual trailer Samsung teased like 5-10 years ago? I still want that collapsible scroll phone from it. But I do need to upgrade soon so I&#39;ll probably get the Fold 5 this year.
UgzFxo5SQdBndBo12GV4AaABAg,Marques I need that Watch 6 review quick ma man
Ugy257ZkSDH-3Me5jJt4AaABAg,Mrwhosetheboss: Biggest Upgrade Ever. MKBHD: Literally The Smallest Upgrade In History Of Upgrades Of Any Tech Device Ever Released On Our Small Planet Which Is Still Pretty Big Though (And Nice) But I Have To Stay On Topic So Have A Good One.
UgxcKMoMsb2zVtqV6Rt4AaABAg,What‚Äôs the point?
UgzOeO8GsFO_uF0QWXB4AaABAg,How much better do the cameras need to get. I‚Äôd rather they invest elsewhere in the phone.
Ugy2o4GMP6cLEZ_uYQt4AaABAg,"They have all the line up and n iterations ready, just watch and fingershoot them a year and year further."
UgyyfFuSBdg1yChHU414AaABAg,Anyone else have any reason theyd upgrade from the flip 4? A bigger cover display just isnt doing it for me.
UgyHxYvBdSbkF-CtTvp4AaABAg,Front screen is too thin still
UgwOuZ6oHY6VRS2SxVV4AaABAg,"So, a lot of the failures of the new Pixel Fold are blamed in the flat folding. Are we going to expect the same problems with this now?"
UgwpDImIJ-SPIlcPGyx4AaABAg,"As someone who has a flip 3 and pre-ordered the Fold 5. I&#39;m glad it was an incremental step up. <br><br>I really liked the fold 4, but I thought the hinge and bezels could be better, and with the flagship processor, so it&#39;s more of a less flawed design of the 4 imo. <br><br>I do hope they innovative on the design, as well as an inclusion of an s pen in the future, but im happy with my purchase. <br><br>I do want that s9 ultra thoughüòÖ"
UgzyA4iuCo_dFdK0Ybp4AaABAg,With the thin front display screen and no s-pen slot you&#39;d think a wider screen with a pen slot would be a no brainer to manufacture.
UgydyV_fON25ayOmEw94AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m06s"">5:06</a> What a pity that B-Roll missmatch with voice.<br>I think I will skip this series, but I&#39;m kinda hyped by folds."
UgwRCtqf2tvUoBoXtp14AaABAg,I&#39;m surprised how many good Samsung phones are coming out and getting way better. Love to see a fold phone that show who calling on the back of the phone and have it light up all around the phone. Hope they come back with a sd card slot and let you add any size sd card on the phone. There 2 TB sd card that are out. Have a limit size of sd card size can be added to it.
UgzcO36Nb5vnAQQ23I54AaABAg,"Has apple had significant updates with their phones with their design since Iphone X? No. Still sells like hot cakes, nobody cares and..... Samsung is copying that as always."
UgzP7l0hicfCx9nVX5F4AaABAg,"I was excited about the fold 5, but it kinda feels like a let down. Yes there‚Äôs improvements, but not enough or at least enough to consider getting it. I think I‚Äôll still stick with Apple and see how the iPhone 15 turns out. I‚Äôm hoping for something interesting, but I feel like it‚Äôll be almost the exact same at the 14 but with USB-C (finally)."
UgzTIWLmCx34GyNvao54AaABAg,Liked for the tab S9 Ultra
UgznF3k4AUhTsogyaFl4AaABAg,"My guess is they needed more time to do some of the bigger changes so they decided to just release the same phone this year with minor upgrades focusing the team on real inovation like the s-pen fit, even thinner design, better battery capacity and faster charging."
UgxMOKrXjvgmtunOVi94AaABAg,"If the next foldable doesn&#39;t fold into an origami koi fish, count me out."
Ugx-sxKXVhSquT3M_Fl4AaABAg,"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=0m31s"">0:31</a> how do you get that bottom menu on the fold 4?"
UgxRbD6ajtz84pyx6H14AaABAg,I&#39;m waiting for a new form factor of the Fold since the first one came out...
UgyT7u-g-yNwo4w0Hc94AaABAg,I like  flex window
Ugy9vXjqtgFsZ3paHP14AaABAg,"Hot take: Unless Apple goes into the foldable phone, they will never innovate pass a certain point since they will never get mainstream enough for manufactures(other than samsung) to throw money in."
Ugwcy6AKNd99YXJT64p4AaABAg,This just seems like a refresh for the sake of a refresh. That&#39;s what phones have became every other year it seems..
UgxWnJwzTm5kVs3hBAl4AaABAg,"Wow no 100mp or 200mp on a screen that opens up! Still stuck at 50 mp, this is no upgrade! What a waste of YEAR!"
Ugxhnf6gDUGmq3KS1jt4AaABAg,That looks awesome

UgzAlJX-PB1frKuQMd94AaABAg,"Samsung great company, support russian Z-invasion"

Ugx-KlcKNkcrvA2O0l54AaABAg,"Ok, made up my mind. I&#39;m going for the new RAZR"
UgyAHQBe6Bn_f7Rk50d4AaABAg,Will you be covering the OnePlus Open that is supposed to launch on August 29? I&#39;m curious how it will compare to the other foldables on the scene.
Ugyz2-dy-_oT07l4Uex4AaABAg,Ok so no one will upgrade this year
UgzwU5CptJXO2O0k3Xt4AaABAg,Samsung is having it‚Äôs Apple moment. Just as other phone companies have takin Apple‚Äôs original smartphone design and improved on them to the point where you can argued that Apple no longer makes the best Smartphone. Here we are again where other smartphone companies took the original design of the Flip and Fold phones and improved on them to the point where Samsung is no longer the best Foldable Smartphone maker. üòÇ
UgxEHnIhbAO-6LUNT6d4AaABAg,"Flop, might as well call it an S MODEL"
UgwOer94eABqV4WpAuB4AaABAg,"I just want the outside screen to be a little wider and a slot for the s-pen!  Do that and they&#39;ve got the ultimate phone.  I did do the upgrade from my Fold 3 to the 5, because I do like the slightly wider screen that the Fold 4 and 5 have and the newer hinge design is a nice plus"
Ugy4Of_9u61xnZ-f3wh4AaABAg,"Samsung using that new cutting-edge Apple process, (Make The same phone,  just charge More for it.)<br>Brilliant!!!!üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇü§£"

Ugwb54REPMYdOM4_NVt4AaABAg,Yeah I&#39;m getting the Google fold üôÑ
UgyPHC6TnuJ61eVGYWp4AaABAg,Might like to try a fold 5 but not without a slot for the pen inside the phone like my note 20. Still with the note for the SD slot and not sure I&#39;m going to even give that up. There is no reason they can not get the pen inside the fold. Guess I will wait another year and see what they come out with then. Pixel might be the one to go with before samsung gets it&#39;s act together
UgxSVlqG0LC-RD4Q7kJ4AaABAg,Thank you for not making cringy thumbnails with mouth wide open like 99% of YouTubers

UgwKLzOGGlCvr8OL98l4AaABAg,How long till apple gets in on the folding game.
Ugy6TH1zRZrBSkYRCI94AaABAg,"The Flip and every other foldable phone like it are so dumb. Like why would you use it? Even this &quot;big&quot; outer screen is too damn small, when folded it&#39;s a very thick phone. When you unfold it it&#39;s very tall, taller even than an iPhone Pro Max. It&#39;s compromise after compromise with a flip phone for a lot of money. The crease sucks even and especially after using it for an extended period of time. Most of the time you are going to unfold it for the majority of tasks you do and it&#39;s not an easy one hand operation. The Fold I can somewhat understand because unfolded it&#39;s like a smaller tablet. I&#39;ve used both and sold both."
UgyKjAj2A4r5JEYk7tp4AaABAg,"Hey Marques! I think It&#39;s quite interesting that you had complaints about the hotdog style front display on the fold, but yeah the keyboard is difficult to work with to say the least. I find myself using those swipe gestures a lot more then I did on any other phone that supported it. Now, I wonder this: You say Samsung has &#39;settled,&#39; and I do agree, do you think maybe we will see a new phone from Samsung next year? We saw some tech demos from Samsung in the folding department; rolling phones, tri-folds, and so much more! It makes me curious as to what is next, I feel like a unremarkable year from Samsung is usually telling of a hit next year. Although maybe I&#39;m a bit misguided on that. I can&#39;t help but think that resources were spent elsewhere, solidifying the form factor of the two current folding phones in order to create a potential third?"
UgzMqmhVPqrlxBbGbKt4AaABAg,"Nah, foldables are not for me. I hate them. I stick to  my new SG23 Ultra."

Ugyc6z5B4-Aq48wVAZl4AaABAg,Imagine a product that Samsung has called revolutionary have to copy internet iPhone Folding phone  mockups or consumer wants to survive. This is not your IPhone equivalent Samsung this is not revolutionary give up. The only saving grace is the Zflip is 1k and they have good offers sometimes.

Ugz-ckh2EO0LuGy-yul4AaABAg,"I don&#39;t think phones can be upgraded every year, they&#39;ve already reached the max specs available today."
UgwHAz9xDp9vc7FUYZB4AaABAg,"Personally, I really like the idea of a folding phone, as I think my iPad is more comfortable to type on than my phone is two-handed but my iPad doesn‚Äôt fit in my pocket and cannot be used one-handed pretty much at all, so a device that fits pockets, can be comfortably used with one hand, and can be comfortably used with two hands, would be <b>perfect</b> for me.<br><br>I‚Äôd be willing to put up with the high price. I‚Äôd be willing to put up with the lower specs than flagship non-folds. I‚Äôd be willing to put up with the hassle of switching from IOS and relearning the OS/losing certain Apple exclusive features I like. But not all three of those things at once.<br><br>Two of them, I‚Äôd seriously consider getting a fold. One of them, 100% I‚Äôd get a fold. But all three of those issues, while they still remain a thing? No way I‚Äôm buying one."

UgwlZfMDMjw0uBsPw1N4AaABAg,the fold 4 might be a sweet deal now ngl
UgxGieXBUJu188w6hAd4AaABAg,"I believe Michael Fisher is going to end up using his Razr+ over the Flip5 as his weekend daily driver. Has a year-old chip but rounded sides and looks better. And Motorola figured it out years ago how to do a cover display on a flip. Mike is also a bigger fanboy for Motorola than Samsung.<br><br>Pixel Fold vs. Fold5 is a little trickier. Adam Matlock returned his PF and then bought it again. He needs stylus support, so Fold5 is likely his daily driver. Snap 8 Gen 2 is more of a massive upgrade from Tensor 2 than from 8+ Gen 1. But PF still has the superior cover display although a bit too wide like the Razr 2022 at 80 mm. <br><br>As I predicted, I think Mike will use Razr+ and Pixel Fold for this year but I&#39;m still 50-50 if he goes Fold5 being how weak and inefficient that Tensor 2 chip is. Fold5 is more like a Fold4S. The big upgrade probably happens next year. Already 4 gens of the Folds that&#39;s more of the same.<br><br>I&#39;m still rocking my Flip3. Yeah, I know battery life isn&#39;t great but I&#39;m fine with it. Did Samsung folds seem to peak in 2021? The 2022 ones only brought slightly better battery life thanks to 8+ Gen 1. It doesn&#39;t look like Samsung is even trying anymore. <br><br>I&#39;m not sure foldables will ever catch on. I believe it will remain niche for the next 5 years and for something for techtubers to talk about. It&#39;s just not catching on with people due to fragility concerns and outrageous prices. <br><br>I&#39;m actually currently using an iPhone SE 2022 as my daily driver. I need to because my Dasher app will make a sound when I receive an order to deliver. My three Android devices won&#39;t make a sound and then I lose the schedule if my break time expires over 35 minutes.<br><br>I don&#39;t mind using a boring slab again and the SE3 is nice to hold and I prefer Touch ID. Don&#39;t care if it looks like an iPhone 6 through 8. So my Flip3 and Razr 5G are usually left at home. More of my Flip3 since the Razr 5G has double storage and fits like 13 of my favorite TV shows. <br><br>My SE3 has a case with a kickstand. I can see more from a 4.7&quot; in landscape than watching videos from a 2.7&quot; cover display my Razr 5G has or if my Flip3 is set in Flex mode. I still use three other Androids daily and I still prefer Android much more than iOS. But Dasher app keeps me on iOS.<br><br>Maybe foldables are just a gimmick? Think about it. You&#39;re basically carrying a heavier and pricier phone and then you might not open it up as often. I&#39;m not a tablet user, so I don&#39;t care for big screens over 7&quot;. I owned iPads and rarely ever used them. I like compact and portability.<br><br>We got the Razr+ which acts like a compact phone. Is it really? It&#39;s still fairly heavy and thick. At least 50 g more than an iPhone 4S. It&#39;s tall when opened. Nowhere as compact, thin, narrow, and light as the iPhone SE 2016 or Xperia Compacts from yesteryear.<br><br>Then people are loving the outer display of the Pixel Fold because it&#39;s wider and shorter. Easier to type on. So they don&#39;t open the phone as much. Doesn&#39;t that defeat the purpose owning it then? You&#39;re owning a Nexus 5 stacked together. Same height but thicker, wider, and doubled weight.<br><br>I know MKBHD has never fallen in love with foldables. What&#39;s really their purpose other than propping it up without a need of a kickstand? What significant upgrade in features do they bring that a slab can&#39;t do other than they can fold? It&#39;s just a different form factor but what practical thing are they really bringing? <br><br>I was recently using my Xiaomi Mi 3 last weekend. I hadn&#39;t turned it on since Christmas 2021 to use the FM radio to listen to Christmas music. Holy shit, it still had battery life at over 60%! That&#39;s not charging it for nearly 20 months. And it still works decently from a phone I&#39;ve owned for 9 years. That&#39;s reliable. I was watching Ash from C4ETech talking about the Mi 3 in 2014 for nostalgia. <br><br>I also started using a modded PSP 2001 model my brother gave me. It still works great! I&#39;m using devices from 10-15 ago and they&#39;re still working great. It got me thinking of getting older phones and such. When phones were smaller, had headphone jack, had expandable storage, and sometimes removable battery which the PSP has. My modded Vita&#39;s battery health I got in 2017 is still over 92%. <br><br>I think smartphones peaked between 2014-2018. A lot of the stuff we are seeing the last 5 years are more of the same with the exception of the foldables, Duos, and LG Wing. You can own a phone from 2018 and it will still work beautifully if the battery hasn&#39;t degraded badly from it. My Pixel 3 still takes great pix.<br><br>What we&#39;re really seeing from phones whether they fold or not is more of the same. The most exciting industry within the next 5 years could be AR glasses. Michael Fisher can finally become Iron Man talking to his own JARVIS while looking cool doing it. <br><br>AR glasses will be more useful than smart watches. You can even leave your smartphone more at home and try to live the retro life from the 1980s and 1990s without social media&#39;s echo chamber frying your brain and ruining your vision from worthless opinions like if Margot Robbie being just &quot;mid&quot; on Twitter or X, whatever the hell they call it now."
UgwYEbogMIXNXRb0bRB4AaABAg,i&#39;m just ready to go back to smaller phones. i have small fricken hands man. these phones just keep getting bigger. tried the moto razr 2023 and just couldn&#39;t do it it was weird and awkward just felt lik it was going to break it.
UgygXwbeT8y91XFcTYN4AaABAg,"Wait... Apple never changes in years, phone do and look exactly the same. You could have the 11 or the 14 and they are pretty much identical.<br><br>Samsung have a great phone last year but which did need work, they make the improvements which every review channel cried out for and now they&#39;re settling? üòÇ"
Ugwpn8PxNnYilMfdBkN4AaABAg,"Fold 6 is gonna have a slot for the S pen. In fact, they&#39;ve made/found a space already in Fold 5 but leaving it until next year for something to be hyped about. Wanna bet? Don&#39;t believe me? Come back to this video and find my comment next year."
UgxT7udgEbkFGbxWs0N4AaABAg,"The new Flip&#39;s cover screen &quot;notch&quot; gives strong vibes of the first Fold&#39;s inner screen notch. Back to the roots, 4 years later."
Ugykw81w9l1YIuZYxR54AaABAg,Samsung has gone the Apple way. There becoming boring and only do tweaks on there new phones. They use to be cutting edge.
UgwLkFDGl73juNSS0vx4AaABAg,Nothing should have screens like this on the back of their phones rather than the gimmicky Glyph. This is much useful than those cringy LEDs
UgyBEXf6xcaK84wD6oN4AaABAg,"Personally, I am still on the fence about getting a foldable as my daily driver which is why I have a S23U. I feel like the reason for the lack of any feature upgrades on most part is because Samsung finally has competition on the foldables globally from the likes of Motorola, Oppo, Google etc., the Fold5 and Flip5&#39;s hinge improvement is a direct response to those competition. They are being reactive rather than proactive in their approach to product development and are going from being the innovator to follower."
Ugxv3UG2BoeUoRmBFvp4AaABAg,"honnestly i would have waited for this thing if it had any rumers on the s pen in it, as I want a foldable in its factor, but the s21 ultra taught me that I want my pen in it because I always find myself wanting to use it, but at the same time I&#39;m fine with the s23 ultra I have now, I have the note back it just came branded as an S Ultra instead, now for a foldable that&#39;s branded note to take the folds place as innovative flagship with a literal mini pocket notebook size (you know those that are slightly taller and wider then a pasport but also hardcover) and we would have the next lineup"
UgwiEM-xKWcI_DZn_814AaABAg,"Samsung Z fold is just too narrow for me. Otherwise, a great phone-tablet."
UgwRdDOqyIJONuI-zAB4AaABAg,Is same thing outer display is suck .. better buy other brand
UgyNhyjl5IinN6X2evd4AaABAg,"From the Fold 4 reviews, it was not worth upgrading from the Fold 3. Would that still hold true with the Fold 5 since there are so few upgrades?"
Ugy1Jm-UQov81FD2uTh4AaABAg,This is soooo sad. Why would you release fold 5 with no upgrades? I was hoping for screen upgrade. If they went for a little bit wider screen this time. I wouldve switched from s23 ultra to fold 5 right away. Not this year i guess.
UgzXfWuV1C-_4AKgO4F4AaABAg,"For anyone buying the watch 6, they have removed the titanium and reverted back to stainless steel. Sure its cheaper and we get the rotating bezel back, but having premium materials is also a nice addition."
UgzlUXjYL4JGys7bEcd4AaABAg,"I like the inner big screen aspect ratio. If you make a passport shaped phone, you can&#39;t have that aspect ratio."
Ugw3u5vm8xI2UXb76Mp4AaABAg,"That face at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=7m05s"">7:05</a>"
UgyidqEDTvW60aXpHLV4AaABAg,Samsung needs to step it up in the fold game making them wider and especially with the cameras on them
UgyX_uKOTJTiy2_GaCx4AaABAg,I have the fold4 wouldn&#39;t mind it being a tad shorter and wider with spen slot better speakers 4k inner screen 20mp front camera and upgraded back camera
Ugy9HwD9KpJy4iLJ7914AaABAg,So you can‚Äôt use the outer screen on the flip like the Razr?‚Ä¶wow sammy you missed out for me.
Ugwv4y2VWyMp6uNdY_l4AaABAg,All these features they have for the new Samsung they can just update for the old Samsung it&#39;s not like the Snapdragon gen 1 is out of date or anythingüòÖ
Ugx_4vUXynomUDtkLv14AaABAg,"WAAAAAIIIIIITTTTTTT YOU CAN&#39;T BLOW PAST THE FACT THE ARE FINALLY FLAT! That and the outside screen were the two biggest complaints now it&#39;s exactly what everyone wanted and it&#39;s too little too late lol, can&#39;t please anybody anymore haha."
Ugx0Ym4cxK1HtGcwqdd4AaABAg,"i think the new flip looks uglier, which means a lot because i mean a big part of the appeal of the flips is their looks"
Ugx78snOpDw456_YlZJ4AaABAg,The real question is when is Apple going to bring theirs out?! Now that‚Äôs a phone I‚Äôm looking forward to !
Ugx5e7d6nJvEzcw5Dj54AaABAg,"Love the content, can&#39;t stand how critical you are of every other tech company but apple. Apple has been doing this for years, incremental improvements, you find things to celebrate but here you critic?"
UgwoIT62gsyJAEoiE_d4AaABAg,I can tell you what happend: as everywhere else in the industry the R&amp;D department got their budgets drastically cut. So they delivered a MVP of a new Flip and Fold and will hold off on new ideas in their drawers until there is sufficient funding in development.
Ugx8fOy4hVeSd-8KpaF4AaABAg,On the watch 6..can you use your bands from your previous Samsung Galaxy watch?
Ugy0yBCWiTfGvIm_Gdl4AaABAg,"The 3 phone form factors are: the Flips, Folds, and the Olds. iPhones belong to the Olds, sorry to break it to ya lol."
Ugyji8jF0Hrham6-sH94AaABAg,"The 5 gen is gonna be the bargain foldable to get in 18 months, form factor is pretty good and the phone is great already"
UgxD7Oit0mfJIQFXdGJ4AaABAg,"Appreciate your commentary! I was wondering why they didn&#39;t highlight the Fold&#39;s front screen during the &quot;Unpacked&quot; event. You confirmed it, no change. For me the Fold will need to go to a full 8&quot; screen, along with a storable S-Pen before I can shell out that kind of money. The phone is nice, but the Ultra is still &quot;Top Dog&quot;!"
UgzgYyiiX_18kieffhd4AaABAg,i been waiting for the S9 ultra :D love  my s7+ tablet only wish it was abit faster and bigger so im gonna uppgrade this year
Ugwyek5OwZH6sD7IWqN4AaABAg,"If the fold had the same camera as the s23 ultra and had the S-pen storage built into it, I&#39;d be sold. Still a cool phone."
UgwBNrPFkscFZQVXKQB4AaABAg,I love Samsung but they better come on. There  are other companies  starting to destroy the foldable game rn. This isn&#39;t gonna cut it.
UgxrIfMzV9vS8emYK114AaABAg,1200 Nits ! not 1700 !
UgzlmY6M7KHadirLeh94AaABAg,The only thing I‚Äôm excited about the z series releasing from Samsung means that new iPhones are just over a year away
Ugx5aNpPDy1jPsxNnRp4AaABAg,You should be able to use the Home Screen on the front mini screen on the flip. Wouldn‚Äôt buy that for any reason without that feature
UgzwyFkB64RBWj3dakx4AaABAg,i dont understand the first phone. What I want from a flip phone is a Tablet in my pocket. This is just a normal phone with a smaller phone on the front. People keep saying &quot;you can all this without flipping it open&quot; when my normal phone also doesn&#39;t need to be flipped to have it
Ugz3xajq3p2v71u_gWh4AaABAg,Watching this on my pixel fold and this is pixel change to update the software and take fold 5 users from samsung
Ugwu-fWq6K_TsLrFZER4AaABAg,Apple&#39;s addition of features in each year is way less than Samsung&#39;s
UgxXJpT63iHy0IrDgvV4AaABAg,RIP dex?
UgyFw5zRNvoHBFVf5bN4AaABAg,make a review on the samsung tab s9 ultra
UgyMj9lY5ec9a5CJPKN4AaABAg,En espa√±ol üòÆ incre√≠ble
UgxHOlj8TwTHNU4rEpV4AaABAg,üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄbrooooooo wtf with that spanish voice
UgzqcbPdW8ahjrkDo5x4AaABAg,I only want a flip phone if it opens with a button or similar. Trying to open it this way with one hand is just annoying!
UgxypGe16FACeVnFNmB4AaABAg,The note 10+ from 2019 came with 256gb 12gb ram + sd card as entry level.<br>We should have 16gb ram in the newer phones.
UgxnxLut68sT0j4H8pl4AaABAg,"I find it funny that Samsung - a brand that used to make fun of Apple in their ads - has basically turned into Apple by taking away features (ie. headphone jack, sd card slot, charging brick, etc) and now making a &quot;new&quot; device that&#39;s basically the same as the last one."
UgzeIGJ-E6NwUW5uq4N4AaABAg,My hinge failed on my fold 4... After they repaired it I never felt confident in the hinge. I immediately bought an s23 ultra and honestly I don&#39;t miss the fold. Samsung needs to go with the dimensions google used. It makes the outer display usable and the inner display better for multiple apps. I always had to open my fold then rotate it to the proper dimensions and it was more annoying than I&#39;d like to admit.
UgyLx40Mzl52ZsNzsnV4AaABAg,1800 for a phone is nuts
UgxTRYHMCyxyB6Qitj54AaABAg,"Sorry, you can&#39;t try to sell the &quot;Samsung isn&#39;t being lazy&quot; excuse. S21, S22, S23, and apparently S24 are/will all be basically the same design. And the Fold isn&#39;t just the same as last year, it&#39;s basically the same as the prior 4 before it. Phones used to have about a 2 year design cycle, with many only have a one year design cycle on the Android side. Now, with Samsung and Apple, we&#39;re seeing like 4-5 year design cycles, and it&#39;s boring as hell."
UgyPa8JO4sJnTWY0wCd4AaABAg,Not going to buy a poor reboot idea of an old concept that leaves a disgusting crease in the screen.<br><br>I‚Äôll wait to upgrade my phone to something that‚Äôs actually innovative.
UgyLIJMpK6Gk5YrJcTl4AaABAg,I think Samsung just need to do a plus model. Bigger front screen bigger battery and add a slot for the s pen.
Ugwc8zm0E1EU_Npx8bN4AaABAg,"I think this is a dead year.  With more and more people gonig into economic uncertainty, they won&#39;t be buying $1800 phones as much.  For those that can afford it, and want one now, these new ones are just enough better that they&#39;re worth getting over the prior generation.  Brighter display, thinner pen, better chip probably means better battery life, better glass on the screen, new hinge.  The same reliable phone, but better enough that you don&#39;t have to wait."
Ugw3wvJf2sNrv_4UA_F4AaABAg,Waiting for next year üòë
Ugw8OFl9biko4WPVWLp4AaABAg,Non skippable ads have started.   But the skip button remains.
UgxFPYyP1CDgRvJBe0R4AaABAg,"Yeah, I watched the event, the flip looks super cool but way 2 small 4 me üòÇ...&amp; the Battery &amp; Cams üì∑ put me off the Fold, <br>‚ù§ my S22U,<br>Hope they really amp up the new differences 4 the S24U...!!! üòç"
Ugz9OjxVD6RylrvOmLl4AaABAg,Not for long üòÇ
UgxqcBODP6r0iYkS3Jd4AaABAg,Make the outside screen more of a normal aspect ratio and I‚Äôll happily buy it
UgztDoU2BkAXot8RjMt4AaABAg,What happens when you have less competition in the market. Damn it LG u need go come back and make a bad ass flip phone.
Ugy27I9rgfEBC7H3SPF4AaABAg,to a about to be 1st time buying a flip this is good to me. I only buy Samsung phones every 3 years. I learned years ago its every 3rd or 4th year thats its a big leap.
Ugx4uK4DN_0-BIb7zNd4AaABAg,I have never seen a regular person ever own a Z-fold or a Z-flip. Only people who do youtube reviewers own them.
Ugyelq-98HC1y6pr9QJ4AaABAg,"With Apple, Samsung, and Google releasing new phones yearly with no real drastic, super wow factor improvements, do you think the Big 3 would benefit from releasing new phones every two years, maybe even three?"
Ugyhd5By4mwlibcsHvx4AaABAg,Z FLIP 5 LOOKS AMAZING!!!
UgyOm0Z5lffGqg1iZ4F4AaABAg,Why R&amp;D when you can just slightly iterate and charge $100 more the following gen?  It&#39;s the way of the giants now.
UgwG3hf_8E8S_JyqYoF4AaABAg,Honestly... the camera placement looks uglier to me .
UgxYaOxxNrrn5V1Zto54AaABAg,I love the look of the Razr‚Äôs new cover screen over Samsungs. Like how Motorola cut out spots in the screen for the cameras. I would rather the screen be a little smaller than having it the way Samsung did.<br>P.S. Specifically talking about the Flip
Ugx98TpQr6YbTELokXN4AaABAg,I wish they would bring back the Samsung Gear S! It was and still is the best looking smartwatch...I don&#39;t want a round smartwatch.
UgzUbJrDgVBZxRBzFQp4AaABAg,"Samsung really knows how to make a phone that folds my wallet in half too. If they keep settling like this, I&#39;m afraid they&#39;ll introduce the Samsung Origami next year. A phone that folds into a crane and flies away with our money"
Ugx6WVe5D7q0XwzLrH14AaABAg,Maybe they are just settling on that form factor like you said but also just going through the motions untill someone else highers the bar then they swoop in and play off that... cause at this point what else is there to be done ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
UgxdYBSNWjJVb51ky4p4AaABAg,If anybody says apple more innovative than Samsung they&#39;re definitely wrong in my opinion Samsung is the most innovative company in the world. Because they&#39;re not afraid of trying new things and the action you put their f*<b>***</b> nose and everything I mean Samsung bills tanks for the military they built Burj khalifa they build washers dryers fridges and everything it&#39;s crazy and they have a division for every thing they make so you can&#39;t say they can&#39;t focus on one thing that&#39;s why their product is not good no they have a division for phones division for washers diffusion for dryers division for TVs division for blah blah blah Santa&#39;s crazy company man people need to understand Samsung used to copy other companies now other companies copying Samsung it&#39;s crazy how the world turns around it goes around comes around I guess
UgxjzOGExyQVC0TvGsl4AaABAg,Am  I the only one still waiting on a rollable &quot;scroll&quot; phone? What happened?
UgxxqprSUZYWr1ueACh4AaABAg,"I do agree with the fold being so tall. It is extremely uncomfortable. I myself have been using samsung products for years now, but the pixel fold is a lot better"
UgxuF2P9FtGLkyjNXL14AaABAg,Sad for fold and flips
UgyEvgwYIyP3kLtxlzx4AaABAg,"I&#39;m really interested in a foldable that turns into a mini tablet.  But they seem to all turn into a more square, 4:3ish tablet that leaves letterbox bars to make it work with apps.  Also the price is TDH as Flossy would say."
UgzuMVLbbwwxSyXDl-x4AaABAg,"I always wondered how well are these phones actually selling or if it‚Äôs still a very niche market. In the last few years I‚Äôve only seen like 3 in the wild in NYC, hardly see anyone using it and you would think best usage case would be in the subway where you can have a bigger screen during your commute."
UgxFpp1tRPoSVkZUMSp4AaABAg,Only thing i wanted in the z fold 5 was a wider more normal aspect ratio for the front screen. I love my fold 4 but that&#39;s the only annoyance. Guess I&#39;ll hold off upgrading this year
UgwaXbMrBxzMrMnmxup4AaABAg,"A year later and I love my Fold 4, glad to see the 5 isn&#39;t much different so I don&#39;t have to run out and buy it lol. Only problem I&#39;ve had is the large screen did crack on me straight down the middle. Got it repaired at no cost really quick by Samsung and no problems since. I&#39;d have a hard time going back to a non-fold phone, love the extra screen space and multitasking on it."
UgxE9jQnd80c0iT1zZR4AaABAg,It took 5 models for Samsung to finally understand that a flip phones should fold flat and not leave a gap in between.
UgzHRTGK3-qFfgWyUhF4AaABAg,"If you really know, you build it."
Ugw19vNZOma5iatfq3F4AaABAg,Keeping my Fold 3.
UgyfTESpa_KWu85LS4p4AaABAg,i want it but its so expensive in my country iphone and samsung are the same price
Ugzi1A-BJxmq1nbqfhp4AaABAg,"Watching this on the outer screen of my fold 3. You really get used to it and it&#39;s not bad at all, same with typing. I use it all time."
Ugx7j2USQ8xXlNa9WdF4AaABAg,Wow tech is getting so boring you guys almost have nothing to say new because each manufacturer is doing the same phone over and over with minor updates üò¢
Ugx_DWVLb73C4Suz6Ul4AaABAg,I don&#39;t want the phone to be wider. It&#39;s more comfortable as it is. Not upgrading to another Z Fold until the S Pen has a slot inside the phone. No thanks Samsung.
UgzHc20HG1iCYgF7gf54AaABAg,Good jobs
Ugwu6rngQRiTyplcIWt4AaABAg,Those Android fanboys who always have a go at Apple for releasing the same phone again every year been real quiet since these new Samsung phones dropped üëÄüëÄüëÄ
UgwzRJ_vPIzFf4AER8J4AaABAg,@mkbhd they said during the announcement the cameras are the same as the S series this year.
Ugy7D_G7IU8FXS88u9F4AaABAg,"Samsung just ne3d to increase the form factor to include bigger battery, s pen slot, and better camera hardware. Then it will be a more perfect phone... look like I&#39;m not upgrading this yr"
UgzYDv0vXAU9iHp_nWB4AaABAg,People dumb samsung. I have fold 4 1tb but i desperately want honor magic v2.
UgwZdbEBEGg9he1S_jF4AaABAg,are samsung phones still shit in uploading smooth Instagram video stories?
Ugx88gf8XZHkHerbOIV4AaABAg,"The narrow form factor of a folded Fold is the only folding shape that does make sense. It&#39;s holdable in one hand. You want a holdable device when it&#39;s folded and a bigger device when it&#39;s open. Others just make big screens which can turn into even bigger screens. Not really usable in real life.<br>And Flip is not an answer for a compact device. It&#39;s so wide, it&#39;s still very awkward in one hand and it&#39;s not really a proper phone while folded anyway."
Ugyq-41OgdzALIP66iN4AaABAg,Always a vibe to watch MKBHD talk about Tech when I&#39;m not buying anything
UgxYYwquPSiYOfcP5_p4AaABAg,"I‚Äôve always used iPhones but really like how the zflip looks. I might even get a zflip in a few years when looking to upgrade, but my main problem is the cameras. Compared to their S line of phones it‚Äôs really lacking. I would personally love to see a flip phone with the cameras of their latest S phones."
UgwOr3ye2pz9mhqjG9N4AaABAg,"wow, I remember when ‚Äònits‚Äô were the eggs of head lice, how times have changed ha ha"
UgwweOVW5R3Hvoccbih4AaABAg,"Here&#39;s what it would take for me to buy a fold:<br>1.Spen in the phone not a case<br>2. If it&#39;s gonna be $1000 don&#39;t make it $2000<br>3. The crease should have been ironed out by now.<br><br>You&#39;re welcome if you&#39;re listening Samsung. Stop playing it safe otherwise I&#39;ll keep the S23 ultra, no reason to upgrade."
UgwrR8yqroghzaBSGUN4AaABAg,Why not talk about how iphones have been the same for five years now .
Ugz3t1iXi2T9kIWyoQN4AaABAg,Remember when the Note explodes? They settled
Ugxt7HARZ_GKMrvgDMh4AaABAg,I&#39;d rather have 2 glass screens than that ugly crease in the middle.
Ugx8v915__Wrc_KmFC94AaABAg,Gee more bigger screens to look at. Like there isn&#39;t enough already on the market.
UgzOKA3lE5OQxxXGQZV4AaABAg,Smartphones are following the tick-tock model. Minor iteration improvement in one year followed by a major improvement the next year. You would want to wait at least 2 years to see any substantial changes.
Ugwo70EuNrWzQrp2dgN4AaABAg,Find your reviews are more of &quot;safe&quot; than brutally honest
Ugwc_OFKH2kYmXY_SlB4AaABAg,Google for the same price has less. I really wanted the Pixel Fold to have pen support like the Z fold line üò¢ cause the form factor is really nice
Ugz4JBKM7uaNdW53qWB4AaABAg,"Reminds me that I have to return my ZFlip 4 after one year of use because of course, the crease has lost contact with the propetary screen protector and is gathering dirt and you can&#39;t just replace it yourself without losing your warranty. And the next Samsung repair shop is more than 100 km away so I guess I have to send it in and not have a smartphone for some time because of an old screen protector."
UgxlJIJ1yCL-aqx49x54AaABAg,So you&#39;re telling me the screen protector is still gonna separate from the screen after couple of months.
UgwUtGo2MEVqoJ6ylkR4AaABAg,"I hope they make a z fold mini, which I&#39;m daydreaming would be the same width as the regular fold, but shorter so that it&#39;s a more normal phone aspect ratio, just smaller<br><br>(Imagine like an iphone mini sized phone that folds open? It&#39;d be perfect)"
UgwQJIlLMV5IeVR92uN4AaABAg,"Why don‚Äôt you design a hinge, chipset or OS?  Lol"
UgyidPmFLqzQsNZJv3t4AaABAg,Samsung hotdog or Samsung hamburger
Ugzan_jPJsGC7NGg0nx4AaABAg,Is this your first video with Spanish audio?
UgylR6IzzD-9LBovGvB4AaABAg,Bro a giveaway of the tabs would be really nice.<br>I am unable to buy due to monetary problems
UgyoLej_13HYSHyBvG14AaABAg,The tall screen feels so much nicer than a wide boy. I would also take a Find N2.
UgyuOXKuHc901Id4imp4AaABAg,I moved to apple because of it. I was giving them the 5th gen to change things and they didn‚Äôt. So now I‚Äôm a iPhone user. I had all their notes and ultras since the note 5. I skipped the one that ticked but besides that I was a big Samsung fan.
UgxDOD7EkIokdEKp8c54AaABAg,Nice looking fold 5 but  bigger battery  should have been made because of all the features
Ugzp1CQUYAQOxz7QWu94AaABAg,I don&#39;t feel like I need that gadget. I mean... how is that better..?
UgzCfG1LWVn5vlOhBB14AaABAg,"I love the pixel fold, I hope samsung one day makes a &quot;shorter&quot; fold too"
UgzTk6NJX6lSljj9WQp4AaABAg,I was so in to buy z flip 5 today if they would have improved the camera. So dissapointed
Ugy_t-5nbtAjLrn1_H14AaABAg,so it looks like they were  lying about improving the crease with the new mechanism . It is exactly same . You can clearly see and I can not see myself buying this even I had millions of dollars as a person who has OCD üòÇüòÇ
UgxJzV0z5XNDjdPZ3eB4AaABAg,"Flip 5 is a major letdown on all aspects when compared with the Motorola Razr Ultra, the Moto is just better with creaseless 144hz display and a 120 hz front display with a much larger screen layout. So going with the Moto Rzr Ultra is a no brainer here."
UgyV175GvmH3smeBgGZ4AaABAg,This is Google for codm like this if u are with me
UgytWFb4citHzx9OYJR4AaABAg,"That‚Äôs one of the things which got me, they seem really struck on Asia market more..or what reason they go for tall narrow screen loook, I need some width"
UgxetDVbtamOTZpd-e94AaABAg,Its fine to release an incremental update to a phone thats already great but getting costs down so the price gets lower would be nice.
Ugx4ZTRfzq-4RLc-98l4AaABAg,These phones are getting uglier and more expensive. I&#39;ve never seen someone holding one of them. I feel that they will end up fading away as they are not practical for the daily life.
UgxgjXs-EkXnNOtKuol4AaABAg,"Hey Marques, I really appreciate that you are dubbing your videos to Spanish but that voice doesn&#39;t match your face at all :/<br><br>BTW Is an IA voice?"
UgwkPVQ4EeEPfNCFDZp4AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m06s"">5:06</a> The Flips and Folds animation do not correspond to your narration. Minor stuff though."
Ugy_j0mTnuIzlvJRLsV4AaABAg,I think they found the sweet spot for the fold. And wondering if battery optimization has improved and perhaps a bigger battery was not needed.
Ugz8HLYvvaOx8El710F4AaABAg,"MKBHD: oh samsung phone, i wont get paid as much as chinese brands oppo, realme and lenovo (moto) so I will simply downplay the hardware engineering and the bigger screen size on the outside while I will boast Oppo&#39;s great flip (a samsung copy originally) with big screen and compare it to a dated vintage phone (because, wow its cool) and will boast about Moto&#39;s big screen as well."
UgxoxAjxtzvuH-7lPs54AaABAg,"Having used the Fold 3 for well over a year, I can honestly say that I think the frontscreen is fine. Yes sometimes I would like it to be a little wider, but I also really like how I can use it properly 1 handed.<br><br>The new folding mechanism looks a lot better, but the bigger question is whether it&#39;s better for the screen. I got quite a few cracks in the middle of my screen, and this is not user error, everyone gets these. They look and feel like scratches, but in reality it&#39;s the top layer cracking due to the bending.<br><br>Using the same rear cameras and not adding other stuff like a slot for the S Pen, is very disappointing. I wasn&#39;t planning to upgrade regardless, but they are clearly not trying to get some real innovation or improvement going."

Ugyx6VFWWZngailCxN94AaABAg,Do you think they haven&#39;t changed much because they think they are pretty much to of the market for these phone categories? <br><br>I mean xiaomi is not the popular and Mi UI trains loads of people away and Google sale of their fold would probably not be as good and the same for oppo.

UgxqtBJN3SsHC8r0Yt54AaABAg,"If it ain&#39;t broken why fix it. Apple has made a history of making small incremental changes year after year. Samsung is taking the same approach. I think they strongly believe in their design and are not going to allow the other folds change them. I would like to see the spen inside the unit next year and possibly a slightly larger front screen. As far as the cameras while we all love new hardware, maybe they should take a page from Apple and Google and just focus on post processing software etc."
UgxLhh1UP0SoZqiXf9d4AaABAg,"I had a Z Flip 3 &amp; a Z Flip 4. Both developed issues with the crease and I&#39;m not the guy who is flipping his phone open 700 times a day. So, until they fix the issue with the display cracking in the middle, I won&#39;t be getting another foldable. Also, still no telephoto camera, which is a must for flagships now"

UgwPbEiDN0E6sqSE4jF4AaABAg,"The form factor of the fold is what‚Äôs holding it back. It should not be so tall &amp; narrow, it should be a bit shorter &amp; wider for both the displays. Cause for most parts, it doesn‚Äôt make sense."

Ugx5PrQRfEcGO2kgEaR4AaABAg,"why would you complain about the fold5 outside screen being too small to view content when the inside screen is meant for that? I think the slim design makes it more pocket friendly and I don&#39;t find a reason to complain about the view limitations when the solution is to just unfold the phone. I feel like its supposed to fulfill the same function as the flip5, but with the whole functionality of the phone. If the outside screen being perfect for everything is what you want then the regular galaxies got you covered and the ultra is big enough to be a better media viewing device than the standard s23 and the plus. The google pixel looks nice, but it almost seems too wide when folded up making you not really have the perfect one hand experience so you have a wider and wonkier to hold folded up phone, and wider unfolded phone. Samsung&#39;s looks a lot more ergonomic and one-handable, and when unfolded the height and width have, personally, better proportions."

And I think as of this year, Samsung has really accepted and taken that.<br>A complaint I saw of the S23U was that it looked the same as last year&#39;s phone, the S23U is a great phone and I don&#39;t see it looking like last year&#39;s phone a problem. Car manufacturers do this, Apple does this... it&#39;s Android phones who always seem to be changing the way their phones look every year. I think with a product this mature, with Samsung recycling the designs as long as they use that R&amp;D for improving the phone in other ways, I&#39;m happy with it."

Ugw3kinXgj0Kw90GO4F4AaABAg,My thought is that Samsung is keeping it safe and pricy in the Fold/Flip segment and they should chill a bit on making a new phone every +/- 365  days<br>They should take there time and bring some new things in The SP world
Ugz1j23tM1HxrfIwODt4AaABAg,I have been a big fan of the Fold.. and even after watching many different versions of folds from other companies the Z Fold was always ahead for me.. the Z Fold 5 is almost there at this point... what I whish them to focus on is really the outside of the phone being really annoyingly narrow that I just dont want to use it at all. ..

UgygCasARVxtwNI11r14AaABAg,"I wish that Samsung would make the ZFold5 cheaper at least like $1600 but I got used to $1800 so it&#39;s okay. Then for S-Pen that made me excited and FYI they already made a case for the super thin pen. Then for Tab S9 series, at least they improved on the durability with IP68 and creator S-Pen which makes it possible for these things to be laptop replacements than overrated ipad. <br>To be honest with everyone here, I&#39;m not picky picky of Samsung making major changes if not I loving what they&#39;re doing with these small updates and I feel that everyone should realise that Samsung will not be the same like 10 years ago"
UgwwwmChD110959HYOh4AaABAg,I feel like with the foldables Samsung or any other company should update these every 2 3 years instead of yearly. These are too expensive and they gotta give customers a reason to upgrade.

However, the fold&#39;s outer display is uncomfortable, awkward and just a pain to use regularly, i would much prefer a foldable with a front screen with a standard aspect ratio for most day to day use, and the landscape inner display for longer use cases. I had the fold 3 and was very happy with it minus the aspect ratio, battery life and inner camera quality (3 things that have not been change), i went back to the galaxy ultra line üôÉ."

UgwA6Pb4mrx2ejywFT54AaABAg,I mean they exactly Follow the footsteps of the iPhone and i dont se it shunned there.

UgyWSIwxlsu2fJoOW1J4AaABAg,I love how this is called ‚Äúthe Samsung way‚Äù but if apple does this it‚Äôs the laziest thing ever
UgxeTkFoM83NvugeqrJ4AaABAg,"Price is fine because it sets the market. However, I was not hoping this since everything was leaked, but I can only imagine what a Z fold would be like if it took Google&#39;s Pixel Fold format and applied it. I have the Z fold 3, skipped the 4, will skip this one, and stick with the S23 Ultra that replaced the Z fold 3. I just couldn&#39;t get with the outer display being so tall and narrow."
UgzJZuVXX5aLMhqdvLF4AaABAg,"And they still keep getting it wrong with the foldable phone concept. The outside display needs to be the main display and must be as good as your regular flagship display with no compromises. The inside screen needs to be the bonus screen that you open once in a while to watch a video, to read a book or to multitask. Currently every single manufacturer keeps trying to make the inside screen to be the main screen and throw everything they can at it, while the front screen remains lacking in look and dimensions. They&#39;ll keep being a niche until a lightbulb goes off in one of the developers&#39; heads."

UgyDeG3ECLQEPHt39nB4AaABAg,I still don‚Äôt see the point of the flip ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the fold makes sense. Open to a bigger device. But people keep raving on about how great it is that the flip has a bigger screen on the outside. Or the Razr having a full outside screen. Why would I want to use my apps on a 3 inch device when I can just unlock my phone and use it like that?
UgyQeCDU7oHLDWr5VPd4AaABAg,"As someone who is moving on from samsung to apple, its once again disappointing to see samsung settling, like there are lesser and lesser changes to the phones so like whats the point."
UgwSkQlBCunpm3b28ah4AaABAg,They r trying to make foldable phone slimmer n lightweight
UgwOqX1skJbEcZcEV694AaABAg,Why do they introduce the same old year phone with a new name???ü§¢
UgyZRKjygF6NlCe5_-h4AaABAg,"I like the shape of the Pixel, but at the same time I understand why Samsung uses a more narrow display. If someone has small hands, they have less trouble holding the phone? Just a guess. There is probably a measured size that fits most hands comfortably. Just a guess."

Ugw_tNKU3y70tyVq6wh4AaABAg,THE FOLD 6 WILL BE WHAT WE WANT...THEY ARE HOLDING BACK TO DRIP THE TECH TO EXTEND THE ROLL OUTS
UgyGH2-Rfa9ZajI2LON4AaABAg,I was hoping there would be something cool from the Fold 5 since I am at the Fold 3 right now...The Pixel Fold looks more appealing but idk if I want to go down to a first gen device...
Ugxpuj50xQDmTB-Xg794AaABAg,the crease alone makes me not want to splurge on such early experimental prototypes....
UgxmwPPGMcpAeH6e9M54AaABAg,His videos are soo calm and relaxing to watch and that too being very informative.
UgwD6HwqNHUZnc1zp1h4AaABAg,I seems Samsung philosophy on foldables is that they want you to unfold them almost always. The cover screen of both models is more for glances not for productive tasks. That goes against the other companies that made basically normal phones that unfold.
UgzaOCdGeqqK2hVhLJF4AaABAg,No crease at all and passport size form factor that would be perfection.
UgwLuWpfXEvM2I7WS1d4AaABAg,i have seen people with Flip phones that are stupidly expensive and broke easly and do nothing different. flip phones remind me of nokia Communicator :D screen getting damaged real soon. ofc it&#39;s better to buy 3X less normal phone that companys make for 15 years now. then foldeble that in the market for 3 years
UgzY1q2IpplwFDFpcFN4AaABAg,"Start the video from 0:0, turn on the CC, thank me later :)"
UgwygiaBN4b1WPcVAgl4AaABAg,"The change that I actually want to see is not larger outside screens or more functionalities when they are closed. I want to see improvements in decreasing the size and enhancing the portability. I would love to buy a phone like the Z Flip, but closed, it is not small enough for me."
Ugy39DdWNgjBFq_vHUx4AaABAg,Hmmmm it still not there so it‚Äôs flip flop
Ugyjvu3HlrbVsRn4QDd4AaABAg,"It looks so fluent, so smooth, and i want it so damn bad!"
Ugyjild0ktpZaXkp0vF4AaABAg,"I just really want the flip [hone...reallly want it, but feel like its a mistake and won&#39;t last long"

UgywdbcpIlh9WjNTONh4AaABAg,Flip phones are a waste of R&amp;D.
UgzzondXk03-q2oyVJl4AaABAg,"I was hoping the fold 5 would be thinner, like the Honor magic v2. I actually thought that was going to be the big change since Honour revealed theirs. Disappointed can&#39;t lie. Guess im sticking with the fold 4 for a while."

UgwY744w98XeiTpSDbJ4AaABAg,"The tall narrow is pretty much the reason I haven&#39;t done the foldable with Sammy, and the Pixel looks fragile AF.  Weak camera sucks at $1800 too...  sticking with My S21U until it dies I guess.  Still super solid"
Ugzl0KwXu5N8VWndF1V4AaABAg,"While it would be nice for more of the hardware to have been updated, I personally appreciate the size they have retained for the fold as my wife uses it constantly since she can text and scroll easy with one hand while nursing. Has been huge for us :)"
UgzPptHSVBBb_FoOgpd4AaABAg,"So if you wanted to upgrade from a Note 20 Ultra, would you go Fold 4 or Fold 5?"
Ugy2CXSXU0lQTPEmtax4AaABAg,"‚≠ïÔ∏è Let me be clear here...most time this man makes a SAMSUNG review, he seems to underestimate the best updates that have always been made. I mean, you can feel it from his voice or sth. Idk. But tbh SAMSUNG is a game changer! They always find a means to make us users experience something new and see the other dimension of smartphones. That&#39;s what a tech company should do, in my opinion. So if you guys are real tech lovers and appreciate CHANGE, go and watch other review makers since this man is stuck to the IOS stuff. [ my opinion]"
UgyzG9Aw5lqMENVdeEl4AaABAg,Folding phones are not the future.
Ugy2V6DLWFCjDCCaOL54AaABAg,"You see, these foldables are really good now, I like them both, but the Z Flip 5&#39;s outter screen is such a win! ‚ù§Ô∏è<br><br>But also, as someone who doesn&#39;t want to deal with Apple and just uses his iPad to consume media, I&#39;m more excited for the Tab S9 ‚ù§Ô∏è"
UgzjQHuYxfdX8XMUTHt4AaABAg,Gonna get flip 5 cant wait
UgzWWTiOigIqgNcIq-d4AaABAg,Ordered the Online only Gray Fold 4. That Matte Black hinge looks sick.
UgyZHZazWZGWfyMeix14AaABAg,Still not Dust Proof.
Ugz3Tk5bdO5LFzND93h4AaABAg,Let&#39;s be very very honest. Almost no one in these folding comments has a physical phone they purchased from Samsung that folds. So saying ppl fell for last years phone is taking the pi**. GG
Ugw7nNZ6UNwfVm3riu94AaABAg,"i&#39;ve never liked the samsung&#39;s fold outerscreen aspect ratio, it&#39;s too tall looking and the bezel shapes are still asymmetrical. i hope they change up the outer scree form factor to something that looks more like a slab phone. <br>i really like their flip phone though and prefer it over the razor&#39;s. it just looks very sleek and premium like an apple product."
Ugy9zoS5Rq5Q4zKyCCV4AaABAg,Hurry up and give me the &quot;other&quot; phone.  I&#39;m over this iterative &quot;update&quot; path....
UgxLEE7deTrNVD0OsuZ4AaABAg,"I&#39;ve been thinking about getting a Z Fold 5, but now I&#39;m really not sure about that. I might just wait to get an S24 ultra because I know it won&#39;t be nearly as dissapointing as the foldables are this year"
UgweObB2cVrzAZ8xIbR4AaABAg,"Speaking of specific app enhancements for the fold series- I&#39;ve been playing a lot of minecraft on the fold. And I noticed a really cool effect thats produced by playing with the screen just slightly bent, and lining up the horizon with the crease. It gives the game a 3d aspect almost like a 3ds. Its not really possible to play like that though, because anytime you look around at all, the horizon no longer lines up with the crease. If Mojang would add in a &quot;snap to horizon&quot; setting in the game, so anytime your center of view got close enough to the horizon, it would snap to it, then this cool little quirk I found would become an awesome new feature."
UgxJ6PEQtovbFlgI7iZ4AaABAg,In the West Samsung basically has zero competition with foldable phones. So naturally they settled with an iterative update to refine the previous devices.<br>Just like everyone seems to have settled with punch hole cameras. What ever happened to cameras hidden under the display? There&#39;s basically zero progress with this Z Fold generation. Are they just keeping it because a punch hole camera would be a step back and secretly they <b>know</b> that it&#39;s not worth it?
UgyUhUbPNaRQrvIkxMV4AaABAg,"seems there is no need at all to upgrade Fold Z4 to this new one... they got lazy this year for sure, I&#39;m waiting for them to add the camera module from S23 and in-house pen to upgrade it. Love the phone, but not excited."
UgwbAY_Pm3xxQOwUkdl4AaABAg,The one thing that the flip needs upgrading is the one they forgot.. freaking battery.
Ugz57J2i_YZLEf6VHht4AaABAg,They make those supper big displays but battery is still the same as in every fold.
Ugx5NkJgnnXmUCPRRil4AaABAg,I prefer the slimmer form factor of the Z fold compared to normal phones. My hands are just not big enough.
UgwdJXs7quKaqd53M5B4AaABAg,"I stii won&#39;t buy the z fold, it&#39;s too tall. I&#39;ve got my sights set on the Google pixel fold, much better form factor."
Ugzg1td9NMzAVYLpXh14AaABAg,Samsung has little motivation to release their very best fold phone as long as Apple doesn&#39;t have one to compete with.
UgxFnWdaK8Cc6xeOCMJ4AaABAg,I ordered a Z Flip 5 today and was pleased that (for now) there&#39;s a free upgrade to 512 GB memory.
Ugy4_jEcKVxN_AKfrAd4AaABAg,How much did Apple pay him for this video ü§î
UgzQjvEoHVbZKG8YjVR4AaABAg,Just why?!
UgyjzkcduxZ65W-g7hR4AaABAg,So you can write full texts from the cover screen now on the Flip 5.  Anyone know if you can do the same with emails?
UgzQtN9MRIfUeIBR_8h4AaABAg,"I want a new Samsung 7&quot; tablet that does not fold in halth or is water safe at one mile under water.  This size tablet is the best one to have but most people just can&#39;t help wanting  a bigger tablet, soon Samsung will be making one that is 80&quot; in size and people will still want one a lot bigger and of course with no bezels, I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not one of these stupid people."
UgwUJvN8rMFFS_9ykBh4AaABAg,"When iphone doesn&#39;t change a damm thing for over years , he ll be like great phone , awesome phone lol , such a apple&#39;s slave"
Ugwpwteit1igaHYTILF4AaABAg,"I have an S21 Ultra, and have always been intrigued by the Flip. Do you recommend I upgrade to Flip 5 or wait until S24 Ultra?"

UgwO88WBtXGytZ-r3Dt4AaABAg,This guy praises every apple product. No matter how useless it is. Someone else delivers less finally his eyes can see
Ugxb2WIJtv_Kd60F1kV4AaABAg,MKB wanted them to pour beer when you fold them or something. üòÇ
UgzykOdIHaokp3vnBmR4AaABAg,People rip on Apple all the time but not even they would just recycle the same camera module from model to model.
UgxaThWMvGel0MYpCzZ4AaABAg,"I might be in the minority, but im just waiting for them to get a stylus in the body to give up my note/ultra."
Ugw5hbK9lqgGQclzQjV4AaABAg,Samsung has gotten so boring with their new phones.
UgyFuyCUKl6aRgvk5Nx4AaABAg,The iPhone 13 to 14 upgrade of the Android world.
UgzaE3mCTXgp6-MqM_B4AaABAg,"Im actually not surprised at all. I&#39;ve noticed over the years of using Samsung that they will typically do minor upgrades for the &quot;new&quot; version of a phone before they come out with one that has actually nice and new features. On there Galaxy phones I&#39;ve noticed this the most. For instance, this years S23 didnt even look like any meaningful upgrades at all. Maybe next year there will be a nice selling point. We&#39;ll see"
UgwAyLgd-bytlh6j-wB4AaABAg,And the samsung tablets are water resistant now you forgot to mention
UgzzQh6w2186RwjefEV4AaABAg,"if they can come with a better warranty, when that screen starts to get green lines or half the screen goes black after so many uses. I do repairs and see a lot of fold devices come in with screen problems from the folding."
UgzoByNtBoAW5jqzdit4AaABAg,I have the Fold 3. I think this would still be a pretty decent upgrade. I think I&#39;ll go for it.
UgyK8J631sn65JE6Y654AaABAg,Meanwhile iphone still living in Stone age just like their fans.
UgxPANCwzZnNwg4-VON4AaABAg,Disappointing overall. S Pen should be inside the phone body for convenient storage like the S23 Ultra.
UgxMuWJbmMuLk21Ze914AaABAg,I hope flip phones dont make a come back.
Ugxkiog-6YzRlWG6E7t4AaABAg,I wonder if they are pushing for better margins on a presumably low margin product.

UgwPNv8UneNPszSq7uN4AaABAg,"Like that Samsung is trying new stuff, but iPhones are really solid now and I doubt I will go back. My 13 Pro Max has the best battery life of any phone I‚Äôve owned"
UgyHGgaCizNhyg-jHw54AaABAg,Since you doesn‚Äôt want to actually say it.. so I will‚Ä¶ ‚Äúboring‚Äù for the most of the upgrades for samsung foldable devices year haha..

UgxiseaQlqhsJhab4jV4AaABAg,I think they&#39;re just too confident about this foldables segment market and wait for Apple adapt then that&#39;s the perfect time to change?&#39;&#39;ü§î
UgyDD_cecQ620zs-0rZ4AaABAg,Why do I feel that xiaomi will take away market share
Ugzr7HNh8XwOEDuBmId4AaABAg,I hope everyone votes with their wallets and they sell next to zero of these z fold 5s... The forum factor is no longer acceptable. Look at the Honor magic V2... That phone makes these look laughable. Horse and carriage vs a Lambo
UgyA-cxob-q5qgdrHI54AaABAg,"The Z fold series form factor gives you the giant inside foldable display, but at the cost of &quot;huh, this is weird&quot; outter display."
UgxFkSGEnAWnzA5Pi4l4AaABAg,Ruined the flip.<br>Ps: Samsung is dumb.
UgyRuLev9E02sJSlBbB4AaABAg,Where them wf-1000xm5 reveiews?
Ugx4SY-GZKf2p1UL1Oh4AaABAg,"I had the Fold 3 and loved it... but I still ended up switching to the S23 Ultra due to the camera quality, battery life and the front display that&#39;s just way too narrow.<br><br>If they sort these things out, I&#39;ll be back. :)"
UgyuIcguuH39FMwtW-J4AaABAg,"No build on Spen is a deal breaker,<br><br>No flagship cameras like the S23 ultra in a 2k phone is ridiculous"
Ugygsofra7tY0aeTxIN4AaABAg,I noticed you using t mobile how ya like man ? I am sure it‚Äôs blazing fast and I think I am gonna keep my iPhone 14 pro max for now until Samsung does something that‚Äôs actually  worth switching back to bc I had the z fold 4 but switched back to apple which apple at the moment is like Samsung also just upgrading certain things to make it better but it‚Äôs the same phone every year just upgraded a little bit I think next year companies need to start wowing us again and make us want to buy a phone now days it‚Äôs not like that anymore I miss the old days when they would innovate I am sure if lg was still around they would of came out with a triple folding phone or something fun and cool
Ugx9oCo7PH4fD3q0hqF4AaABAg,"Good bye Fold 4, hello Honor Magic V2! This is how you lose a customer Samsung, well done you!"
UgzXdK5YJjD2vxQoIiB4AaABAg,"I have the Fold 3 and my wife, the flip 3. We waited for the 4&#39;s and found they were incremental improvement at best. So we waited for the 5&#39;s, and they are not the sweeping improvements we are expecting (like the 2&#39;s to the 3&#39;s). Maybe Samsung is holding the real improvements for the 3 segment foldable in the future. But at 1800 bucks for the Fold 5, which was the same price for the 3 and 4, what ungodly sum will they charge for it?"
Ugz-4FzvPbbSHJSIe8h4AaABAg,Seems Huawei leaving the market did the predicted damage
Ugzl6WXIPhzLswrYDI94AaABAg,Lol<br>.. when samsung settles
UgxTznU37TjmmzZe36F4AaABAg,We definitely gonna need s9 tablet review
UgwnftqwZm4DJZdKF-R4AaABAg,"I don‚Äôt understand how a beats with a 10 year old design got more praise than these devices, with new hinges, a new front display and a lot of software optimization which were needed ‚Ä¶ thats telling Marques"
UgyQi2drO3OLti6VCsF4AaABAg,"iPhone new colour gets a video from you, but new samsung watches and tablets are just a 10 second mention in other video. IDK what happened to you dude....."
UgyNx5T_m8FMun7wKOl4AaABAg,I am getting old... or new tech is not exciting at all......... Only things that was exciting was koeingsegg gemera and apple vision pro
UgxFT4YrT8XNJdlh3wd4AaABAg,DONT READ MY NAME
UgwewizlfsTf-KwFiRp4AaABAg,"Better than RAZR plus? Thanks for the review. I just bought a razr plus and loving it every bit, except the slight departure from galaxy UI which I have used for 15 years. Do you think this is worth just returning the razr plus (still in 14 days period) and getting this one instead."
UgyICfW6ihB632JFXSh4AaABAg,"I think for once, they are going to realize the market grows and some people steer away from samsung due to other options. Samsung doesn&#39;t have as strong of a ecosystem as apple so its easier to pull out to go to oneplus, nothing, motorola, google and so on. I was hoping for a flip with 4200 mAh to make a change, but they can&#39;t be bothered."
Ugw-tscj5qgHi7Kz9qR4AaABAg,Samsung doesn&#39;t make Major changes until the 6 or 7th generation. They have a record for that.
UgwFyHbcPdQVI3Bh9Dx4AaABAg,"It should&#39;ve been named Z Flip 4s, or something like that, as Apple does for minor upgrades, not a 5 series.<br>Thumbs up üëç if you agree"
UgxuGcCvU5r_KoIFgb94AaABAg,"Complete let down. Flip 4 has a better and more useful screen. <br>Also keeping the same camera on Flip? It&#39;s been the biggest disappointment. Hinge is still solid on my Flip 4, what exactly have they upgraded?<br>Also, the storage was getting &quot;free upgrade&quot;, so you&#39;re not getting any additional storage if you&#39;re buying the phone in first 3 months. I would&#39;ve upgraded if they had given solid camera upgrade."
Ugw-60UEn1GHyEWG_s14AaABAg,The same tho? Damn very disappointing. I was hoping the camera would be better.
UgxLhoVdJdsWBUYUlzt4AaABAg,"As long as Apple and Samsung can keep Chinese phones out, there is no reason to improve more"
Ugz6ckPYsvFXZPPQpEl4AaABAg,Remember the days where a 3.5‚Äù screen was the entire smartphone? Now it‚Äôs just the font display‚Ä¶ have times ever changed!
Ugz9Bl8SxpMsJSYR1Ex4AaABAg,"I see so many adverts for fold/flip phones in England, but not really any for others. As though they are really trying to get rid of stock and increase popularity?"

Ugx7BQzkOCplHvvt1_p4AaABAg,"ok we get it they settled but where&#39;s all the rest? Make it thinner, lighter weight, bigger battery, pen inside the phone, better cameras, cheaper, ANYTHING.

UgxF3u1EBMFVFG92P714AaABAg,These devices feel like they should of been last years. Same with the watches and tablets. Probably a good thing for consumers as now ppl have more incentives to hold onto their devices for more than a year.
UgyejRiwly2_47Ymjzt4AaABAg,Foldable phones won‚Äôt matter until Apple makes one. Don‚Äôt yell at me for saying that because it‚Äôs true! ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Ugyn90Vv6W0ZDFZ0TFJ4AaABAg,"Nice phones, but I feel like foldable are still not a thing, despite how hard Samsung tries to make them a thing. And it won&#39;t be a thing until they&#39;re cheap enough that mainstream users can afford them"

UgwodHw9i__CxVzai-B4AaABAg,"does it still have that stupid bixby side button that&#39;s non-reprogramable to google assistant, and bixby assistant that&#39;s default and constantly being pushed in the forefront?"
UgyT-M84WryynNsjBHN4AaABAg,I love how he criticizes samsung for being almost the same as last year but loving iphones for the same thing
UgzTwXr-_cygSg5bIhJ4AaABAg,"I just think the price is toooo high...$1800?!?!?!?. I guess I will stick with S23 or flip till the price comes down, say by $500"
UgxWQbzdsI3V5IF0z8d4AaABAg,Man all the samsung stans were telling me there would be no crease.  What happened
UgzqQwXGBME4FExpXc94AaABAg,"It&#39;s all about the bottom line. The trickle out effect like Apple, no big updates, and taking advantage of the FOMO and loyal customers. Samsung has all the data on who will upgrade no matter what and who most likely won&#39;t. Of course, they know the screen needs to be wider but that will only come after they finish soaking us for the minor updates here and there. Now let Apple come out with a flip and a fold where it&#39;s wider and bigger then Samsung will go all out and make the major upgrade. Samsung sees Apple only making minor changing and still selling so they want to do the same!"
Ugx3I9m69_kt3dsVu094AaABAg,"Samsung&#39;s stubbornness with the weird outside screen on the Fold is going to cost them sales.<br><br>Been sitting with my Fold 3 waiting for the Fold 5 with a &#39;normal&#39; screen  to upgrade to but still after a number of iterations, no change. ‚òπÔ∏è<br><br>Honor Magic V2, here I come."
UgyaR4Y3pW0z7gp2Bel4AaABAg,"I love my Z-Flip 4, but I don&#39;t know if I like the cover screen bigger, I&#39;m glad they are making the hindge better as I did have my screen break &amp; couldn&#39;t unfold my phone, they fixed it for free. I wish they would&#39;ve updated the camera with the new ZFlip5. So now with my flip 4 fixed &amp; working perfectly, I&#39;ll keep it to see what they do after the ZFlip 5."
Ugw-uIT8T7iSzHWP77l4AaABAg,I don‚Äôt see the practicality of a flip smart phone. Just seems like a gimmic to me
UgxbwXVJY0OQDCviz694AaABAg,"I like how the S23 Ultra is a culmination of the Mega, Edge and Note phones"
Ugz9rskQfrfVWPFyylF4AaABAg,The unchanging game changer
UgxBSwJyBYGta0wvmEZ4AaABAg,"I actually really like the narrow/tall folded form for when I&#39;m out and about. Makes it really easy to one-hand swype messages or entire emails quickly, which i&#39;m doing all day. I&#39;ve had every iteration of these and I love it."
UgzK4rn04nSbZuitset4AaABAg,The only way I would upgrade is if the hinge is better the z flip 4 is very fragile
Ugwdd-N_w6A4_t8D8Wp4AaABAg,Nope they haven‚Äôt settled. Wait till next year üòÇ
UgwvZzwmtCdx2fhON454AaABAg,"Good, they&#39;re confident in their product. Not gonna slander them. I think fold 3 was the &quot;one&quot;."
Ugzmp05m5752NnCCZJp4AaABAg,So the z fold is a small laptop?
UgxORkzvYuGDwoJB6KN4AaABAg,Seeing these devices in person is truly impressive. The screen tech is amazing. Would love to see Apple give it a go with their spin.
UgxQZyrN2r6hknBoJA14AaABAg,"I&#39;ll probably have to see this somewhere else, but is the outside screen on the flip have more functionality like the new razr? seems like a no based on you only talking about the widgets. If it doesn&#39;t have that functionality imma pass"
Ugyv8ia6lUk_hR58vhh4AaABAg,Do anyone buy these things? I just couldn‚Äôt imagine going away from a ‚Äúreal‚Äù glass screen and I don‚Äôt really see the appeal with a slightly larger screen when a device like an iPad does these things so much better? I‚Äôm really surprised this has not gone away like curved tv‚Äôs did.
UgwHV-b73-zFxNpWIPN4AaABAg,Samsung is the pioneer of Folding phones!
Ugxf17f8DCf4AGSOx4Z4AaABAg,Woah.. Never saw that tablet before. Looks awesome.

Ugya64wwLtVe_rlsBtR4AaABAg,I am IN LOVE with ‚ù§ S9 Tab Ultra
Ugz39NQmPh3lCK-WpsJ4AaABAg,to be fair the most important components to innovate around regarding folding tech is the folding screen and the hinge mechanism
Ugyyz0_zQ7H2cTID3SJ4AaABAg,Name them Flip 4S and Fold 4+
Ugw0E-hc7Ov66M5eAjF4AaABAg,"Samsung did get lazy!!! Fold could and should of had a wider front screen, ultra cameras and a built-in s pen. This should be called the Flop 5."

Ugwc7Jp91UgmEFtZpb94AaABAg,S 24 ultra release date?
UgxpgZ9vlWxxDRwKK214AaABAg,MKBHD wallpapers app? is this the new app coming up??
UgwpD-xTKH4H7iI12gl4AaABAg,"Honestly I much prefer the Google fold for it&#39;s designed making the folding a feature and not a gimmick <br><br>unfortunately it&#39;s a bit cheap and the battery won&#39;t last even half a day for me<br><br>Not to mention that it&#39;s way too over priced for me, not liking the idea of paying $2,000 in a couple of years for a phone"
UgyHr-YCqftWnQYT1LB4AaABAg,"As someone who owns a fold 3, my takeaway from this is, Fold 3 and 4 owners shouldn&#39;t upgrade and new buyers should save money and purchase a Fold 3 or Fold 4( if you want better cameras). There are not enough enhancements to justify paying full price for a Fold 5  and you will save a LOT of money"
UgwiC_DtgRPxSjkrF6x4AaABAg,"My daily for the last 10mo is a fold 4 and, personally, the narrow aspect ratio of the cover screen is one of my favorite aspects (lol) of the phone. It makes it much more... Grabbable? Idk how else to explain it, but it makes it much more comfortable to quickly perform basic tasks and for everything else i just pop open the inside screen. Totally cool with them sticking with it as a differentiator from pixel/others, though i doubt they will long-term."
Ugw5ZOP6sgyMplPlFaZ4AaABAg,"Flagship price should get flagship quality cameras. It&#39;s one of the most important phone features for most users, how many of us carry a separate camera anymore?"

Ugy8ToSfCnQI6WO2R-R4AaABAg,"Man I&#39;m kinda happy that samsung isn&#39;t producing massively improved products every year. It&#39;s very obvious that people who have money will end up buying the latest phone if it&#39;s a big update, which is the biggest reason for an increased carbon footprint. No accessory removal will ever match that reduction by not buying a phone at all."
UgyirY66BxxSxEhgV3R4AaABAg,The change in the flashlight placement is the biggest upgrade they could&#39;ve made.
UgzbBZfcXuLimVD9EPd4AaABAg,"Sooo<br>Now i want this flip, it is amaaazing üéâ"
UgxapUph50lbrIFJnKd4AaABAg,"Actually, they made the fold 4.1"

Ugzosc8bxPFNBI0vfjV4AaABAg,Love my fold 4...<br>Fold 5 is not anything interesting.<br>I wanted a better camera.
UgwiJtgaGRRvUmplhk14AaABAg,"ive been waiting to upgrade since the fold 4, this year has once again disappointed me.Problem is we know of the chinese phones out there,that just makes getting a device like this very very hard. I will wait, Fold 6 i guess, or a new category as Marques says.... the next phone to mimic the  Magic V2 is going to be the samsung I get....but alas, to wait another year is going to be painful"
Ugw6-YhrAc144IV7F5B4AaABAg,Quality of sound and video of this channel is probably best I‚Äôve ever seen. I enjoy every video even on a 8k TV. Thank you . Your effort is appreciated

UgxI9TO7ttQhpS19PJ54AaABAg,As a Z fold 3 user I&#39;ll be waiting for the next fold for an upgrade or even the Fold 6 who knows but it&#39;s getting better each year so I&#39;m glad w these subtle changes
UgxLAjEKyZhxV-IGSpZ4AaABAg,Please do the review on the tab s9 Ultra!  Hopefully it ships with cellular this year
UgyoV9f6xHZ48rCp3Ex4AaABAg,The Mega was fire tho üòÇüòÇüòÇ.  And I def had the note edge too.
UgwK_PUoSMgHCUp1_VR4AaABAg,I think that samsung shouldn&#39;t have to change the looks entirely every year. If it&#39;s not broke dont fix it. The hardware and internal components have been upgraded and with a way more efficient and powerful chip. If you don&#39;t wanna upgrade then don&#39;t. We are at a point where there isn&#39;t really so much changing to a phablet phone that we can change without being over the top. I think the design language is clean and subtle on both apple and samsung.
UgyksYyLOpg1vvdwUMN4AaABAg,Why do I get the feeling that you are an Apple man?
Ugwje22FKvn9HdVc9ed4AaABAg,For this normal might look at a foldable down the road some day.  Love the hinge update on both models.

UgyV0RmxCaQyf_n8EWl4AaABAg,I have been waiting for the Fold 5 for MONTHS! I was soo excited and was dead set on buying it‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ meh. It‚Äôs too damn similar. I actually think I‚Äôll wait to see what the google fold does next year as the form factor is way better. I‚Äôll stick to my iPhone 12 for now.
UgxZdj7jKWihCJp3cWt4AaABAg,why does he sound different from the usual?
Ugwtabk1R4FlIv8PsVh4AaABAg,The new Flip also has a larger battery at 3700 mAh. üì±
UgyNRudBjnaVMSZhmOh4AaABAg,I wonder if Apple will ever make a folding phone.
Ugx2v7MU5yRNwbrkqKR4AaABAg,"In my opinion, the standard Tab S9 and Flip 5 are the only products that have actually had a real update this year.<br><br>I know the Fold is the perfect smartphone for me, but I&#39;m waiting for Samsung to release a Fold with an external screen in the format of the Huawei Mate X3/Honor Magic V2 and a battery üîã of at least 4800mAh. <br><br>Samsung can release a Fold in the format and with the hardware characteristics of the Huawei Mate X3, but to want too much to recover the money invested in R&amp;D in the format of the Galaxy Fold, Samsung risks arriving at the opposite result and losing in the medium to long term.<br><br>The Honor Magic V2 and OnePlus Open are not far away..."
Ugz1_1O5EiaFFCB8MFN4AaABAg,Dude this man has come so far. So many subscribers. Remember when I started watching him when I was 15. I‚Äôm 26 now
UgyPcC-xHzqun2brXOJ4AaABAg,The Honor VS 2 is only 9.9mm thickness.
Ugy_5gnkrFmLfB_XpU14AaABAg,"Im increasingly becoming more and more disappointed in my favorites Tech youtubers. I agree that samsung is getting lazy, but Apple uses the same design for years and they don&#39;t talk about what is the same as the multiple generations before it. I think as a reviewer, you should have your preferences but leave biases aside. And praise all companies when there is innovation and bash them when there&#39;s a lack of innovation equally."
Ugx9cM6_KGXqnsZClxl4AaABAg,I think Samsung will eventually make the Z Fold a little bit bigger next year just to make the  Spen room haha
UgwxLv6clD8Q34yw4cl4AaABAg,It is what apple does for iphone every year.. but but no complaints..<br>Samsung ohh that&#39;s problem

UgxxHJJr-ecDeUaF8sp4AaABAg,I&#39;ll pass. S23 is just fine for me. NEXT!!!
Ugz9Qu-1Yu7MyXycTmJ4AaABAg,"This guy is just an Android hater, especially Samsung products. If it were Apple making this device he would be ranting and raving about it."
UgybbYZ2_Us0tNbX-lh4AaABAg,"Samsung does what it does since the days of S8, S9 next year we will see a new iteration of the Fold 5."
UgwNGZW0CiyKpkZpcV54AaABAg,Sometimes it feels like reviewers will take 15-20 minutes about apple&#39;s some minor software changes and they are giving 8-10 minutes for 3-4 product of other companies like here they just mention tablet and watch and move on.. <br>I think it&#39;s all about views.
Ugxy9W5g_csEYl9P6wR4AaABAg,Been waiting for a mega phone since the last one.

UgxJkUmyXbvxQLTO6md4AaABAg,If only the z flip would get the cameras of the s line it would be my next phone for sure
UgzX4yYSQ9CdOLitj_B4AaABAg,"in 2013 i was using a smartphone with a 3.2&quot; main display (galaxy pocket, still working), and now that&#39;s the size of the auxiliary display of the flip, kinda nostalgic"
UgyTmSHAoUHa9t0heqJ4AaABAg,lost bit a of respect when using ther s20  then  moving on the s22
Ugz2dI1eYwVU9mcN6VZ4AaABAg,i own a fold 4 and i absolutely love it. and i personally am a big fan of the tall narrow cover screen
UgyMncBpQTTEgaV_wHR4AaABAg,"I felt this unpacked was kinda underwhelming. I have been waiting since the beginning of the year for this event and I feel like a deflated balloon after watching ‚òπÔ∏è  I think they should&#39;ve taken some more time to make more improvements like cameras and other hardware updates/ fearures but the watch was especially disappointing. All they talked about was &quot;sleep this, sleep that&quot; like what?? I work a blue collar job so sleep is a luxury and I&#39;m an outdoors person outside of work, not everyone is some yuppie office snob so I really was hoping for a rugged version with more outdoor aimed features like Apples larger watch but damm... That blows... I&#39;ve been a samsung guy from the very beginning. I&#39;m kinda considering Apple even though I still hate their ui ü´§"
UgyGfEnUDsSy3oeqxC94AaABAg,Great I love your videos bro
UgzT2pZcgoTRiRVLOvp4AaABAg,"Can you do a video on Motorola‚Äôs Razor and the Galaxy flip 5 please. I need a new phone, and I was really hoping for the galaxy flip, but after seeing your video I‚Äôm kinda sad"
Ugy-su6FKiT8ign9ac94AaABAg,I suspect these Fold programs are extremely costly in terms of R&amp;D. So this is an attempt to turn a profit before innovating next gen.
UgzAa6_vbfrWoPDs5aN4AaABAg,awaiting for zack to annihilate these phone. hahaha
Ugyv140W5ujvkz-zTmt4AaABAg,I like Samsung but will never get a fold unless they chage the folded factor because the super tall front is so awkward.
UgxDy38lJcpwFrBY0sZ4AaABAg,not worst than the battery decreased on s22
Ugxi6O7lfssDw2szOsZ4AaABAg,Disappointed. My wallet is safe.
UgxOMl5m1sKU6VCcX194AaABAg,I don‚Äôt see why a fold should have a fat outside display then what‚Äôs d need of it been a fold you need bigger display open the fold
UgznrQPErdbwRxl5V6J4AaABAg,"Honestly, this was the most boring keynote and phone release I have ever seen from Samsung. Phones must have a purpose and convince users on why you should get one. All I can remember now is Apple releasing the Vision Pro headset and its still rent free in my mind till this day. Because why? I have a vision on what I wnat to do with this device. For Samsung, these devices no longer have character or vision since they are just a heavy copycat machine. Hence why they settled HARD!"
UgzA_O7A0b3acMT4pIV4AaABAg,You know the most painful part is that you mkbh always praise apple but if you look back since 2017 apple has been repeating same design but you dont criticise apple you criticise other brands and that is not fairüöÆ
Ugxo1ZDGB7k24pRG8714AaABAg,That tablet bet it will bend and bet they won‚Äôt get as much shot as apple would over itn
Ugwzl16TkKf7DcQIZfZ4AaABAg,No new cameras is weird these are premium prices
UgwC_BfA2k6r6oXNnzx4AaABAg,"Maybe I just grew up, but I couldn&#39;t care less about phones anymore. Cheap phones like the pixel 6a/7a do everything I could ever need. It&#39;s just not impressive anymore, especially at the price of a used motorcycle."
UgwSxW7D_eRZgz8sNg94AaABAg,"I feel like the fold is a bit overpriced, it‚Äôs almost 1800 and the only improvements are the chips and front display durability and the hinge"
UgxVS5up5bsArHjEAuF4AaABAg,"sorry but i had to point out that the animation of &quot;the flips, the folds and the others&quot; is incorrectly flipped. It shows the folds, the flips and the others :) . Minor but i know how you feel about these @mkbhd."

UgwpOOQgta3beurnVFl4AaABAg,"I just don&#39;t understand &quot;the flips&quot;.<br>Very uncomfortable phone body type, needs 2 hands to actually open it to use it, it&#39;s nonsense"
Ugygklx6f6A3ZykXL9Z4AaABAg,A flip with better battery and camera would be a better deal for me personally.
UgyuQ646lvc8k_yPRWF4AaABAg,Should just call them the Flip 4s and Fold 4s
UgzEIEfyVgtefxkZ_iN4AaABAg,"remember Fold 4?? it still has so many bugs. Screen freezing, cache shitware, etc. Even their crappy software it&#39;s full of bugs. No thank you. I will stick with my super fast, 4 years old, iphone 11"
UgxAF_AgpnD2hQhj8Gt4AaABAg,Casually talks about the s9 ultra tablet in 6 seconds at the end
UgyWHJMukll15ru_36d4AaABAg,Do you ever criticize iPhone for having the same form factor for literally years and years?
UgzWCxGM7Vmo_dhxm4l4AaABAg,"The only thing that I still dont like in the Fold series, is the outside screen, I&#39;d like it to have the same size as any normal phone, more like the Xiaomi foldable"
UgyXL7Pr1ReKuJh4Hmp4AaABAg,Disappointed with the Flip5.<br>I want to use the screen as a normal phone and not just widgets.
UgxElR3oyTOqX55PBsp4AaABAg,Samsung really need to stop running stream 1.5 hr before launch with adds on loop. Its so booring and can‚Äôt know actually when the event will launch. Waste of time thats all.
Ugzw_PVA08Cbyt_YjhJ4AaABAg,Looks like samsung will swap upgrades each year to each these models. Flip 5 new this year next year will be new fold and so on.These companies know how to make 5 $6000 off of one phone. The flip 5 could have been made from day one. Let me guess in 2 3 years the flip will have the &quot;extra zoom camera&quot; little increments = mo $$$
Ugy9gfQyUzgag6ab6414AaABAg,Become like apple i see
UgwJnypaIuvizuBhJdR4AaABAg,Shoutout to the Samsung mega. It was my favorite phone
UgyRUAoKVICmxwfQO3J4AaABAg,"The fold phones have always been so unique and fun to look at, but I&#39;ll stick to my note phones. The Galaxy S23 ultra is just such a great phone. No reason to upgrade or change for many years"

Ugzs8FZ9PLWzOHqVJL54AaABAg,"I passed the flip because it has no Dex mode. For a phone that expensive, Samsung should include all the features. Maybe next year..."
Ugxx4dRcQm38Ac74e454AaABAg,"Nothing exciting about this. Keeping my s23. Big enough, better camera and  better overall in my opinion.  Cheers!"
UgxI8wEarWsdmA4WPzB4AaABAg,Bruh
UgxwHbMRHwzr_0mwUIt4AaABAg,Wait until Apple invents folding phones two years from now
UgxAWpZRTLwQRDUSQj94AaABAg,"I am shocked to still see the crease in the Z Fold 5. I have seen other fold devixes almost remote the crease. I am sick of only having 2 options in the United States. We can chose Apple or Samsung and then some creap phones. In Europe they get access to all phones from Xiomi, Oppo, Honor and more. Those phones are way better than Samsung and Apple, yet we cant walk i lnto any store in the U.S. to buy those phones. We have to pay an arm an leg to buy them online."
Ugxm6XooeTw-gtN2FfZ4AaABAg,"Samsung basically is doing what Apple does‚Ä¶ put out the same device with minute incremental improvements every year instead of packing in a lot of new hardware innovations. But playing devil‚Äôs advocate, the smartphone era has definitely capped so features and abilities are not as frequently released because if you have 5 new hardware features and you put them all in one phone, what will you have for the next generation? So instead of giving you a pack of cookies, they give you one cookie at a time."
Ugx3Dl4s_d5GN-MUYWV4AaABAg,The Samsung Way - slowy give incremental additions to maximise profit gain over the long term... until a competitor comes up and take it to the next level ... and they will upgrade enough to stay competitive. Let&#39;s hope the Chinese players come with strong products to push them forward.
Ugza_o1wQ3c4ai_pYMV4AaABAg,I&#39;ll get a Fold 4 on clearance for 900
UgzxaABk9fl13SVQFH54AaABAg,"Samsung is aware of the competition but they also know that they are waaayyy too mature compared to others. If I had to spend 1800$ on phone, I would be happier with the Fold5 more than the Pixel Fold."
UgzQAuweR_AHvirAFIR4AaABAg,"Well, I was hoping for some more improvements.  Looks like I&#39;ll be sticking with my Z Fold 2 for another year."
UgzCJtD95iV-KIKQ-xt4AaABAg,Down playing Samsung doing incremental updates every launch kind of ignores Apple&#39;s exact strategy for the last decade

UgzfVOPccjda4KVp72l4AaABAg,Joke really
UgxOC78wcjXUkKyVSeh4AaABAg,"As a Fold 3 user that bought it day one, I am extremely disappointed that the Fold 5 is just a Fold 3++. I really wish they would make the phone slightly wider when closed so that the cover screen could be more usable and maybe allow it to have enough space for the S Pen to be internally stored. Plus, you&#39;d get a bigger internal screen. Guess I&#39;ll be waiting another year for an upgrade, just really hoping the Fold 6 is a significant upgrade otherwise, I think I may give a Pixel Fold 2 a try."
Ugx_OlbJHcCirSIVrF14AaABAg,Samsung is dead
UgwgP6MVrtD0kYwlR394AaABAg,I personally like the tall form factor but I respect why people dig the wider front screen. I honestly don&#39;t want them all to be the same though
UgzLL6JqN6RURvspTyJ4AaABAg,People been laughing about iPhone when they release a new phone with very little updates but samsung has went the same path. I haven&#39;t bought any of these FOLD phones and never will

UgyVz7LpPTVnb9Xav914AaABAg,Id love to see a comparison between the Honor Magic V2 and the Fold 4 v2 if youre able to get your hands on it. That seems like a legitimate improvement over current foldables
UgzLX_bmBJu4dFjf9oJ4AaABAg,The Razar Plus is amazing. Far better than the new flip. Its ultra thin. Its light and has a beautiful screen display inside and out.
UgwT1jkjdwLEuIFcJL94AaABAg,Have they fixed the issues with the screens breaking along the fold?
Ugwn61_JgD05BbZFDLR4AaABAg,Love your videos! Question: If you had to choose between the Motorola Flip or the Samsung Flip 5 which would you choose?
UgwcRjjXQoWfy6eapa94AaABAg,Smartphone companies are running out of ideas!<br>Nothing impressive comes out anymore most of the time
Ugybl5SDkUX8BSGM0k54AaABAg,"Fell for the flip 5 512mb, I just like them old clamshell phones, hopefully it has some feeling to it."
UgzVgoPp63d05eSYmDB4AaABAg,They definitely settled! I really wish they would&#39;ve at least made 2 versions of the fold! A ultra version would be sweet for those who want a wider front display and bigger battery.
UgztzlB36zjHJ_FJ9uJ4AaABAg,"Thankyou for telling me the same dimensions as of last year, but befoe I was wondering of to go like the s23 language that is small enough to go on one palm."
UgwUUuo861F2uTOP57N4AaABAg,Thats apple CANT* do
Ugx6SvVbh2cjRXWlo3p4AaABAg,Where is S9 tablet review?
Ugx_WHEGO3EdUfSuPp54AaABAg,That&#39;s it no more Z Fold 5 since everything is pretty much the same I&#39;m ordering the Google Pixel Fold better.
UgzqAm7WWrKFQH3F4Sh4AaABAg,It&#39;s a shame we can&#39;t use these huge OLED high refresh rate tablets as portable monitors? Makes you wonder why it can&#39;t be done via USB C
UgzAIiay2FDY3suHmf94AaABAg,I have Flip 4 but I&#39;ll be switching to Fold 5
UgxAnpS-r-_xZaNMIKh4AaABAg,"I would have upgraded to the Flip 5 today IF they had put the same 50mp main sensor as the S23 phone, but alas... they choose to stick with the paltry 12mp sensor. No thanks! Not for $400-ish with taxes and accounting for my trade-in. Definitely settled."
UgyuFBhrEbvP20jKWrl4AaABAg,Hope they start losing money so that they start giving a damn about their products.
UgwGS-AVe5ZRjCxPgEt4AaABAg,"You should do a throwback video for the Kyocera Echo.<br><br>While that phone was a brick, had bad battery life, and a very poor processor, I actually really enjoyed it overall, even with the seam between the screens.<br><br>I carried an extra battery with me if I needed more battery life and swapped it out mid-day. <br><br>Being able to queue up YouTube videos on one screen while watching videos on the other was a game-changer for my content watching.<br><br>I wonder sometimes if the Echo&#39;s design would have given a better foldable sooner, but people didn&#39;t really pick up the phone at the time and Kyocera/Sprint&#39;s abundance of patents on the hinge tech probably kept it from ever being picked up in the market."
UgyEH9o6mz6kt-SkzLJ4AaABAg,i just need fitbit on the galaxy watch classic to switch. keeping my fold 4 - the hinge is not worth me paying 700 ucks by trading in my fold 4
UgyhrgslJ5TsFMiNBwt4AaABAg,I&#39;m getting the z fold 5. I&#39;m due an upgrade I have the s21 plus. So to finally have a foldable is going to be so cool and I can improve my mobile game gameplay videos on my channel and play games that are high demanding with the new chipset :) can&#39;t wait!
UgzeQTHGxHElZYupOBB4AaABAg,"Still confused how we went from &quot;Having a pop up selfie camera introduces more parts that can fail, we rather have a hole punch!&quot; to &quot;Yes, I totally want to have my display fold in half alongside my whole damn phone!&quot;"
Ugx29SNmaGuBepn0VRl4AaABAg,What I wanted was a new improved PRICE.
UgwyObAXa3R129ZPdXl4AaABAg,samsung finally admitting defeat in their stupid form factor. i hope they pay patent fees to huawei or oppo or whichever android company that‚Äôs actually innovating in this fold market
UgyEFM5IqHSFxa73q_h4AaABAg,Samsung customer service is terrible on too of all this. I&#39;m done w them
Ugz9c3vuO4uYYgskkRd4AaABAg,After getting the food 2 3 and 4 I&#39;m done with them.
Ugw7W5-lGJnGEpRxn_Z4AaABAg,Ok
UgxtkqDA-5zT-6EIlg94AaABAg,Make 2 separate videos for: <br>- Samsung watch <br>- s9 ultra tablet
Ugx2zG8F6n1gXHYa37F4AaABAg,"I really don&#39;t see a need to come out with a new phone every year. At this point, there&#39;s no real innovation that makes it necessary. They&#39;re just going to add more numbers to the spec sheets. And let&#39;s be honest, those numbers don&#39;t apply to most of us anyway."
Ugzfwita5B8pVlKv8BJ4AaABAg,May be it is just me but the fact it folds completely flat is a massive deal finally
UgyRLniiHn217w2lJIt4AaABAg,"Need a s23 ultra fold with 10.000 battery üòä &amp; 2 tb off space + card support üòÆ ,until then i don&#39;t care üòÖ"
UgxrBqoId7Hw8Kh9SBh4AaABAg,"I love the shoutout to the Galaxy Mega, it bugs me out how that used to be such a gigantic phone and now its just what most of us carry."
UgwCkn3ID5H8XFbA5YB4AaABAg,Samsung way is still way more impovements than Apple
Ugz1ZGM1tDlJlxkfxJd4AaABAg,"&quot;except for all the stuff that changed, its all the same&quot; yeah thanks bud"
Ugz6CHBazMYgnhTthDN4AaABAg,"I knew it was inevitable but I really wished they&#39;d delay the tablet release a little longer &amp; included the Gen 3 Snapdragon SoC&#39;s that are coming out in October, that would&#39;ve legitimately made those tablets an instant buy"
UgzZnjO0My3WANqrA3R4AaABAg,"I love my fold 4, but I&#39;m not buying another fold until Samsung makes it the same size as a regular smart phone when its closed. I just don&#39;t like that thin aspect ratio for 80% of my phone usage."
UgwU41UY0XDaI2dKXch4AaABAg,Buying flip 4  now worth it ? On discount?
UgwtHnPH80NQvAPmEgN4AaABAg,disappointing
UgzpmL3_GRgtSLj96ih4AaABAg,These foldables are not going to become Big thing with that design.  Why have a foldable that folds out into a slightly bigger regular phone?  I would love to see a tablet sized foldable that fits into my pocket similar the the surface duo.
Ugz1rtHT56ixZLxks5d4AaABAg,"Been a fan since so many years (from an older profile) and I always hated how you try to hide your subjective opinion and preference for apple, you give them slack and excuses when they mess up or sell the same bs for many years ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
UgwPSsPcnBjbfJcXMPp4AaABAg,I wish phones didnt release every year
Ugx6UnwOT2uf6Nu9vAh4AaABAg,They don&#39;t have to change up the design just make sure all the internals r better...bc no one has a problem buying apple bc all their stuff looked the same for yeeaars I heard nothing from this guy..
UgzrIXC5wKboJL8dtqN4AaABAg,"2 years rockin my fold 2,,, im still happy with the phone it still feels new, working all the time no glitches what so ever,,, and the battery is still amazing and stays all day"
Ugx-4Pb0gGEUDKAs8T54AaABAg,I don&#39;t get why they wouldn&#39;t update the cameras and make them flagship phones.
UgzwLJxmyukwOEZnoyp4AaABAg,Not surprised if you have the Fold 4 this phone wasn&#39;t going to be an upgrade and you might have to wait for the 6 or 7 to see something worth upgrading to. I do wish they&#39;ll take cues from the competition and change the screen sizes though.
Ugw-gKvV3RNOPSuy9wh4AaABAg,"I refuse to buy foldables from Samsung when I can just go on aliexpress and buy foldables from Huawei, Oppo and Vivo.Cheaper and with better technology."
Ugwd9atfxytnTqGayKh4AaABAg,Galaxy Note 4 was peak samsung
UgxE8aAXDNOA5llCkcZ4AaABAg,"Just make sure u open up all your videos saying the same thing about iphones, airpod pro&#39;s, apple watches etc bc they all looked the same for at least 10 years..just keep that same energy in the opening of ur videos..."
Ugyyq7hKWAlXCg5Z33p4AaABAg,"Just add a slot for the S Pen , call it a fold N series and work on the price and just give me that. With regular upgrades"
Ugw2nYS0e0CwGoval-t4AaABAg,I still wanna see another 5 or so generations before i buy one but they&#39;re looking incredible
Ugwxg_tzya7plmal2gJ4AaABAg,Can you use the same phone covers? This is one of my biggest irritations they change the phone design only so you need to buy new phone covers. No improvement for the use. But i would like to see the two upgrades fast charging would be nice on z fold. 25w is 2019 fast charging. The second is the cameras i would love to see improvements.
Ugx5a4Wo_YFeSch_AEl4AaABAg,Improved animations
Ugyr-Ojr4fRQLUZ_k_V4AaABAg,About 15 yrs ago I had the blackberry flip now I have z flip 4
Ugx4bx_w_XYkin_jbN14AaABAg,"Honestly the foldables are awesome devices and the tablet as well, but I still cant justify the prices... For example the S9 14inch tablet looks AMAZING, but what will I be doing on it? Just mainly consuming media and movies etc. Android gaming? Not really because these devices are overkill for android gaming. Then we talk about emulation... sure that is a direction we could go and have fun there, but the hassle to set up is a turn off to me even though I know how to set it up. Then we speak about Moonlight and streaming your games to the device. Sure you can do that, but then you need to have you PC up and running to game. You also cant game anywhere else other than in the same place where you gaming PC or laptop is set up. So yeah. If software was designed for the tablet and there were actually games that could make full use of the tablet specs then id consider one. I cant justify spending this type of money just to watch content."
UgzVDm91GbK_daQtAMB4AaABAg,more like the apple way. milk it til death
UgycLZYfx8JDb1OhvZp4AaABAg,"the degree of disinterest in the last 2 phone reviews is impressive. it seems dull... and without spark. compared to other channels. He did not emphasize anything new. details of the 2 screens, the news in software, etc. even if it is a first contact. It seems that he is less and less interested in this branch of technology and is turning to podcasts and cars."
UgzXOcN0XIFsJfiXsbh4AaABAg,Imagine having better processors on &quot;flip phones&quot;
UgwFahmOJVamR_u4YAB4AaABAg,Looks like imma stick to the fold 4
UgzU3TS7QWbDlGEoKGF4AaABAg,Ek phone mujhe gift kar. Do brother  im indian
UgytV5yjLus0uaHk6VZ4AaABAg,Settles? Bruh they need to focus on optimizing their device give them a few years it‚Äôs new tech.
UgwdMTRTlvcKldKuACh4AaABAg,When you realise that first smartphones had the touchscreen of the size of Flip&#39;s outside screen
Ugy7nO6-zTWftk5i3354AaABAg,"If they didn&#39;t add app support to the outside,  I would take the razr over this..."
Ugxyw3gmCAgTl64AF_l4AaABAg,"i will not buy the samsung fold until they either redesign the front screen or release a new folding product with a more normal aspect ratio, all the other companies can do it, samsung just stopped innovating, and I am not a fan any more"
Ugwyj0D111ZuwevxXC14AaABAg,Samsung is literally turning into apple. They are clearly not interested in what their users want. A larger outer screen on the fold device is what people want. Samsung you suck
Ugw5Ib0jOpzd_WNyrYx4AaABAg,"Dude makes a video about how similar the Fold is to last year&#39;s, but goes nuts over every new iPhone that&#39;s pretty much unchanged every year.<br>Dude also made a video years ago about how gimmicky foldable screens are.<br>So EVEN when samsung does revolutionize the game, he&#39;s just so blas√© about it.<br>And when small updates are made over the previous year, he is again blas√©. <br>So basically pretty much, I can sum up dude&#39;s entire channel.  It&#39;s built around TWO products.  Apple.  And Tesla."
UgxBxXWR8oyCt2xD9QF4AaABAg,Bruh seems that no one is matching the Honor Magic V2.. that phone blows them up through the window.. could you review it please
UgxU91v6Yk1LM4wTpjp4AaABAg,Why don&#39;t you Review Huawei and Honor Smartphone anymore ?
UgwA2PjgIfhAgLEVeR54AaABAg,"These are great phones, but I have the fold 4 and recommend everyone look up the warranty horror stories. I have a hairline scratch on the side of my phone whilst never being out of it&#39;s case. They voided my warranty when I wanted to fix the fact that it stopped unfolding after only 4 months."
UgzJQdcsxTnG4LVzvJZ4AaABAg,"Very disappointed with the fold 5. I was hoping they made the outside screen bigger, like the pixel fold."
Ugz-a1IPIUEi-vj5xHV4AaABAg,"wow, love your content, Marques. Keep up the good work!"
UgysUMKmQgFfhkQs8Vp4AaABAg,I feel like Samsung is turning into the Apple of Android. They do things that is not cutting edge but is good enough for 90% of the users.
UgwoWQf39o7CzO08Ye54AaABAg,I think these incremental changes reflect a change in ethos of samsung as a consumer company. They want to show the world they are not experimental. If u want something reliable which works u get a samsung ‚Äì like u get a apple
Ugwm2M5kQPV4_SUPdft4AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m05s"">5:05</a> Even after havinf heavy production team, they misplaced the animations for flip and fold ü§î"
Ugx-HVXp1HWyd03jQUF4AaABAg,"Pre-ordered the flip5 from flip4, $100 after trade in, easy buy!"
Ugyohb-_mKaWBpFOIrl4AaABAg,"I still say that the Fold should be as wide as the GS Ultra formerly known as the G-Note. With that width they shouldn&#39;t have a problem making a slot for the S-pen just like with the G-Note, and have a larger battery. I&#39;ve seen many complaint that if they make it that big it&#39;s going to be too heavy to use. Tablets are heavy and people still use them."
UgxA5yLRq_wlZRIYUFN4AaABAg,My screen on z fold 4 broke it self and I didnt get warranty. I dont trust those flip/fold phones. Even the shop sample broke wich I looked
UgxZfzfq5Yz3YlJ1fUt4AaABAg,I normally get a phone every year but man. every once in a while i do s skip when tech kinda flat lines. I am passing on the phone 5 but will get the 6. i do like the 5 slim spen case and cant wait for it to make it to the fold 4
Ugz-IAyGAljG5HkzoI14AaABAg,mega is bigger than s23 ultra ......we r still using way smaller phones
UgzdeOsUYQKHAux8Yc94AaABAg,They got no real competition. Once Apple comes out with a folding iPhone then they‚Äôll start innovating again.
UgxQX6R5wyi3ZW8catJ4AaABAg,"last Samsung phone was S7 edge the amount of breakthrough on that compared to this or even the s23 shows that they really have settled, a pop out unit for selfie would be better considering it already folds and that camera will not be used often as a result"
UgxVmj1V_AhD6lWiJqh4AaABAg,This is not fold5 <br>Its fold 4s with shit ratio format<br><br>Bye bye samsung  i buy HONOR FOLD V2 !!!!
Ugyo0P6eJ2ovGTeHORp4AaABAg,"As someone who has had the Z fold 3 and Z fold 4, the only reason I would change out to this is for durability, Not sure what the real lifespan is of one of these, but they have no issue making it to a year so I might upgrade anyways. but I&#39;m really disappointed, especially on the camera front. My wife has an S23 ultra and the photos are so much better from it I would like to see at least an incremental step in that direction."
Ugy4q1roeGf-a5e6wE54AaABAg,"Do not get me wrong, I love my Z Fold 3 (probably will keep it for a while) but One thing I do not like is the crease on the inside being very noticeable in decently lit areas. However I am Jealous of the Pixel Fold due to the better camera. I already told my friends that I love the Fold so much that it will probably stay as my choice throughout the next couple of years."
Ugzd4cek_HkXf31JlKd4AaABAg,Samsung disappoints again
UgwAETglErUxa77chRx4AaABAg,"I love these foldables but the problem is that they exists separate to the other Galaxy line. This means that there needs to be separate features for each but never a combination. Meaning I&#39;ll never experience a Flip with the camera setup of the Ultra, and that leaves me gutted."
UgzRBef2ijgde4QccrB4AaABAg,I think the best thing we can expect for these two years is just TSMC new chips and the new battery (EV) technology.
Ugyquao6_G4pIMubSGp4AaABAg,Motorola did way better
UgyUjTwooeBKF-xE76J4AaABAg,"Bummer - was waiting to buy a Z Fold 5 in hopes it would have more improvements over the last version. Doesn&#39;t seem to be the case, and is hard to justify that price."
Ugw5Fs445kYteI5CwC54AaABAg,I will prefer my motora RAZR+ over the flip 5. The screen is still larger and more usable than the flip üòÇ
Ugw-iQ2KHRD6yd2ugsJ4AaABAg,Hear me out. Why haven‚Äôt we seen a tablet foldable? I‚Äôd be interested in taking a dip in this foldable tech with a device I may not rely on as heavily as my phone. Just a thought I could see that selling well.
UgxdJjpc_AqesUgNuJR4AaABAg,Too expensive still.
UgwFbZXpJhvbMeH19Ht4AaABAg,Disappointed
UgzavxaecguiqBVQRW14AaABAg,I dont believe gorilla glass improved at all since 2015. I bet they just recycle the same shit and call it new names for marketing purposes.
Ugy-be41dQM8VWHEl-94AaABAg,i hope the fold 6 comes with samsungs telephoto lense :(
UgxnruuYWJTLGF-yOu54AaABAg,Foldable phones are garbage
UgwwCa0k_Xusd87FJnJ4AaABAg,The tall and narrow front screen allows one handed typing with that extra thick brick. I think that‚Äôs the reasoning behind it
UgxGafcw7pq80ZrnXld4AaABAg,Can you feel the hate for Samsung in his videos or am I seing something different? And wait for his apple reviews the tone and videos are starting to feel biased in my own opinion.
Ugwil4HEtqWHyu9X5Ld4AaABAg,Pixel folds looks front looks so much better than fold. Pixel Fold 2 gonna look really good.
UgyTqxnci1nus7G3UxB4AaABAg,"If i had to choose between the new Razr and the Z Flip 5, i woyld choose the Razr"
UgxiTXEHUg8CiLsW2RN4AaABAg,"Pretty Boring TBH....No inovation whatsoever! If they stay on this trajectory,  other phone companies can take advantage rapidly!"
UgwKikMMg_ULFTBk_054AaABAg,Correcting the phone you reckon..  Hinge. Brighter screen. Snapdragon. 4your apps.    Mm.    The sound is good. The colours are nice but need to buy from the Samsung store. Storage ok. Sounds people quiet.    Just thinking.     I think go see it in person.  Hold it and really spend time maybe see it couple of times then see.    ‚úåÔ∏è
UgzkBuIKFxxnxEfLkZJ4AaABAg,I really like the Z-fold. I think it‚Äôs the most important phone since the iPhone especially now that external screen is SIGNIFICANTLY more useable. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Apple is taking note of this form factor‚Ä¶
Ugx3wx5kl_5Zoy-pUU94AaABAg,The fold really needed a slimmer size tbh
UgzoEzXozqN7osIVcb14AaABAg,I don‚Äôt understand foldable. They‚Äôre thicker and seem cumbersome. When open the screen has a crease in it that would bother me to no end. Does anyone think the crease will ever be eliminated as tech improves?
Ugzj2fvxFd1eM91WeGp4AaABAg,"Have fold 4, no point upgrading, lets see what samsung does next year"
UgwZF2moJlf4tJ46ITB4AaABAg,"I just can&#39;t get past the design on these two foldables. That narrow outer display is a deal breaker for me and the manilla folder look on the outer display on the flip, is just weird. Not this year for me Samsung."
UgxG8uP3TbYd15ye6o94AaABAg,"I got a fold 3 at launch... and see no difference from the 5 and my phone. Which I guess is good for me, I don&#39;t have fomo lol. I can now gaurantee 3 years life of this phone if not more"
Ugyxpwv-vYh8zZkcHNp4AaABAg,I continue to disappointed with the Fold. For its price it should have the best of everything. I can&#39;t see why anyone would buy this over the S23 Ultra.
UgwICe5r-dLSltAbKJV4AaABAg,"side mount finger print sensor always bad ideal if you use the design after six months, under screen finger print sensor for outside screen much more better"
UgxkuHbUImvOGRzv-G94AaABAg,"Uhm, apple literally settles for 5 years and you never bash on them for it.  üòí"
UgyQrtLjG2AlwIyFZ7p4AaABAg,"I&#39;ve been interested in the Flip for years, but the cameras are the most important aspect of any phone for me. Until Samsung finally puts S2X Plus equivalent cameras onto the back of a Flip I won&#39;t switch, despite how much I&#39;d love to try it."
UgySBOAm-WqfNP41zvt4AaABAg,So why should we even buy this lool? its lazy.
Ugx9k0rNtQQRDjKFJ9F4AaABAg,Did you stop that stopwatch üòÖ
Ugx_Cu9GcAY7-CPf5rJ4AaABAg,Can&#39;t wait for the wrist band attachments for the Flip.
UgyD47hbEdRWex_Hk_R4AaABAg,Im waiting for them to have an internal s pen slot then I&#39;ll upgrade from my 3 to the whatever maybe the 6
UgzXVgt1E2a0knFDj3R4AaABAg,Samsung is the best <br>More love to the company ü§ç
Ugy6f9XLf3BLMBOV-bl4AaABAg,I like the Flip and I kinda want one. Pixel 7 or Flip?
Ugw_Hf3itjHyhvl2xZd4AaABAg,"I don&#39;t care about whether tons of new features has been added. My flip3 will become a flip5. The fact that it folds and finds a wonderful place in my pocket goes beyond anything else under the sun. it is not going to be my pro photo device. It is not going to be a gaming device. It is going to be the tool I use for text, phone calls, paper reading and email."
Ugxg0xFJoe8PqLQH1AR4AaABAg,"I think by the time competitors started announcing passport shaped foldables, Samsung was already done with planning the production of Z Fold 5, so we&#39;ll maybe see their reaction next year... hopefully"
UgwjSTMt_MNrGZqGoXR4AaABAg,Doing a tablet review occasionally would be great!
UgywnJ9TKiKj97mYxMR4AaABAg,Man speaks truth..üôå
UgyIayRn3WJVSPYy0fl4AaABAg,I would very much like durability test of tab 9 ultra..
UgyDBdlWqdt-JN5kjzN4AaABAg,"Even if there&#39;s not much difference from the last gen, you still managed to make a 8+ minutes video on it. Expected better from you"
UgzgNloHuLgQcjCJDPJ4AaABAg,I cried when I saw the watch with the bezel. I&#39;m so happy.
UgwGRmOgCgD4M7XA0Gp4AaABAg,As a former z fold 3 user (now s23 ultra) i can say that im done with the z fold until they well like you said make a whole new phone. The main issues for me was the awkwardly narrow outside display and the square like inside display which seems useless watching content or using most apps because when you do it will show in normal aspect ratios but then it feels like a huge waste of display space when you have those giant black bars so it kinda defeats the purpose of having that bigger inner display. And yes i know you can set the settings on the apps to fill the entire display but that also defeats the purpose because then you&#39;re chopping off a huge usable amount of the video or app.
Ugx_SCZ_HO_iPj0jU9N4AaABAg,"I really want a foldable that is made for media consumption. (16:9 or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=16m10s"">16:10</a> aspect ratio on the big display= full screen video consumption or smaller borders if you watch 18:9 or 21:9 content.)"
UgxAg9jKne-uTIHKZGx4AaABAg,They should&#39;ve made the tab 14 a foldable like the fold lol
UgzgZNofi99B3_5_LDZ4AaABAg,I don‚Äôt understand why people need a folding smart phone lol
UgyAJnEM6qaaDIv2NWh4AaABAg,Reviewing Samsung products when wearing an Apple Watch .. isn&#39;t it kind of .... ?
UgxFim0XJ5wUjOqJ3up4AaABAg,Samsung flopped! I&#39;ve had every fold but this year they took off. I got the pixel fold and even though I love the Google features I love the fold and I thought I was really gonna have a tough decision to make but I don&#39;t at all
Ugwbj3gIp1bdaQ7SG1F4AaABAg,2nd look at it :p Whos the Boss I watched 1st :)
UgxFE2AkEl0k9B4GTCJ4AaABAg,Dope tech: a boujee and normal priced rock tumbler?
UgzcrYL7r09Kqq5MBgt4AaABAg,"Not innovating too much is a good thing for now, too many of their last gen folds didn&#39;t have reliable hinges or screens"
UgzdovpzyX-zsucm-ft4AaABAg,"All I want is a Fold Ultra... I know I&#39;m not alone. I don&#39;t care about the pen. I just want the full camera array including 10x, ip68 water rating, best processor on the market, best battery life possible."
UgxIBjpAfcqrTBkeAot4AaABAg,Fold z 4 is the best deal RIGHT NOW!!
Ugy1Cab8zKbP_sA_BxR4AaABAg,The z flip looks hella slick probably finally im gonna move to flip side
UgyJqY5UObM61kPJNWF4AaABAg,"I kinda stoped caring about the fold series phones after the fold 2, the reason being that I personally see it as impractical and something I&#39;d never use, I do know that a lot of people might need it for productivity or just wanting a bigger screen or something but I don&#39;t see myself using it anytime soon. However the flip series I&#39;ve always loved, I think it&#39;s the form factor that works, and it&#39;s super badass too taking a flip phone that&#39;s a smart phone out of your pocket. I daily a OnePlus 8 pro and there are a few things keeping me from buying the z flip 4 or 5, that being I don&#39;t like the Samsung UI, and I&#39;d also like the hardware to be better in the Samsung phones. My OnePlus 8 pro has a 10 bit color, 120HZ, 1444 nits of brightness, 4K OLED display. It has 12GB of RAM and a snapdragon 865, and 256 GB of USF 3.0 fast storage. The thing is still lightning quick, the cameras are super impressive, the design is simple and compelling at the same time, the haptics are great, the software is great, everything about this phone still keeps up with modern day flagships even though it&#39;s approaching it&#39;s 3 year old mark, and I dont see a need to upgrade just yet. I also need to buy a manual car first but that&#39;s later. Anyways I&#39;ll probably upgrade to a Sony phone in a year or so"
UgzrUEbLvxQK1HLiBrF4AaABAg,The poor camera quality is a deal breaker for me.
UgwWNKB7VVwJeCBpWtZ4AaABAg,I&#39;m contemplating my next phone after my s21 ultra don&#39;t know whether to jump to the pixle fold or stick with samsung and go with the fold 5
Ugxn30dbuxWUSOXBeiR4AaABAg,"I agree.  I&#39;ve been constantly waiting on Samsung to enlarge the outer display of the Z-Fold to match the aspect ratio of their regular smartphones. Until they do THAT AND store the s-pen INSIDE the phone, I will NEVER consider buying it!!!"
UgzTbSUEorVlnleBnqR4AaABAg,This makes the Flip even more desirable now...
UgwF0i9hfO5Ffbku3m94AaABAg,I have a fold 4 I was gonna upgrade as smaunf upgrade program but seems I won&#39;t be I was really waiting for better cameras
Ugwstv1rVN7ZZHLnj-l4AaABAg,if not much has changed for the new fold 5 then there seems no point of upgrading at this time
UgwPI1hzjWsIo_MyvhV4AaABAg,"I do remember the Galaxy Mega, that phone was a beast in its daysüòÇ"
Ugx6JRafpahg4hj3ruN4AaABAg,"I‚Äôve always used iPhones but really like how the zflip looks. I might even get a zflip in a few years when looking to upgrade, but my main problem is the cameras. Compared to their S line of phones it‚Äôs really lacking. I would personally love to see a flip phone with the cameras of their latest S phones."
UgzhACFNTFPWE_pyCwF4AaABAg,"In my opinion honor has killed the fold with their v2, it&#39;s amazing."
Ugz-Q7agw-10KpLaDFx4AaABAg,"I got to have the flip 5 in hand, you can type on that lil outside screen it&#39;s kinda lit"
UgzjwZAy8SEsPTKffqV4AaABAg,Samsung even destroyed my slab note 20 ultra with updates... Lines came in display after update.. And back plate came off on its own before 2 years of complete usage
UgwvPQ_cEwODVW0j9cF4AaABAg,well their slogan isnt &quot;never settle&quot; lol
UgwiDpHJf0YG78RIZZl4AaABAg,Love the video! Would really appreciate if you did a full review of the watch and the tablet too. ‚ù§
UgxuBtw8kPx4mj-ldml4AaABAg,"Nobody is buying these. Stop promoting them, Jeez."
UgwW_LWdDGX0-B8hBcd4AaABAg,my zflip 3 broke after 1 year of use.  left a sour taste in my mouth.
UgyL6iwJVMDdve066MF4AaABAg,"Great video as ever! <br><br>Only one small nuance (or however this word is spelled) - you mismatched the animation for &quot;the flip&quot; and &quot;the folds&quot; on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=05m06s"">05:06</a>"
Ugz93yPKFJU-ggbuWPN4AaABAg,I love watching videos on these phones and playing with these phones at the store. Apple needs to hurry up so I won‚Äôt have to keep thinking about switching to android
UgybROhJjfogpJAIAr54AaABAg,base storage doubled is huge! it is 200 dollar value right there
Ugy5i7NCZjVQcZRwOVp4AaABAg,I believe the big screen will be cracked like z fold 4 after frequent open and close it and is not cheap to replace the Big LCD.üò¢

UgzjFFv14X88AaubJFh4AaABAg,"Even coming from my fold 3, im not even sure if it would be worth the time to switch to a fold 5....."
UgwzhcD_bK6Gyv7DoYR4AaABAg,Needed a bigger jump. Currently on the fold 4 and love it but find it too thick. Hoping the outer screen might be slightly wider. Let&#39;s hope oppo or honor bring their phones to the uk
Ugy0NMYR22uq4eJ6lid4AaABAg,"Hm, both phones are easily skippable"
UgzKBZ__BFGzKBCvyDd4AaABAg,"They need to made it not so tall and thin, wish it was wider and not so tall."
UgwCS8nHAzGC-4taajZ4AaABAg,"Hey, Marques, do you think apple will have a flip phone? Or they already have but they are holding it to give to the public the best flip phone ever?"
Ugwc4wY2GEwJpGOR5514AaABAg,TechImma1st
UgyvY2CscF-SCtYuj4h4AaABAg,"Ok, did I fall asleep under a rock, when did Samsung announce a new flip?"
Ugyv7QfRsFbIzpFzFtB4AaABAg,MKBHD casually dismisses the upgrades as &quot;not a big deal&quot; and its shocking... These phones are coming with the biggest upgrades software wise in almost every department. You should head over to Mrwhosetheboss&#39; review and other channels... This is really below the bar to be very honest.
Ugx9_dtMbLqZgadaxWR4AaABAg,I know he‚Äôs just speaking facts but this dude has a way of taking away my excitement for a new phone.
Ugw7c9t7mSfe_HmoRIN4AaABAg,And apple is not upgrading since 6 years
UgzeCPu_h8Yq8fkWkHx4AaABAg,"It would have been cool to have a battery and camera upgrade with this new model, but honestly, I am not bothered. <br>They were flagship quality from 2020, which is already plenty. The battery lasts more than a day, and the pictures I take are already clear enough.<br>Plus, this way, they can keep the costs down. The Fold 5 is actually <i>less</i> per month than my current S21 Ultra when I bought it back in 2021.<br>If they did make it full-on flagship, the price would be ~$3k.<br>The one major factor from my buying a Fold was the hinge not closing all the way. It looked ugly. I am glad to see they fixed it.<br>This solved the issue, and I will very likely buy one when my current S21 contract is up."
UgwGrOKDRtwpMj5clxZ4AaABAg,"I still have my galaxy mega, but it doesn&#39;t start, and charging doesn&#39;t work maybe my screen is busted. I have no clue"
UgyGYxrt_Pdsgut09z54AaABAg,"welp, So I waited for nothing.. Only thing I wanted was to fix the goddamn aspect ratio of the cover display and mke it wider"

UgwAvpGUSrN7QQMEYb94AaABAg,You showed flip and said fold. And and showed fold and said flip
UgxRwrhi6dzbUlEz1oB4AaABAg,Would only be sweet if they were holding out for a Fold Ultra
Ugw9ibq8lUi9d-8YUa54AaABAg,Thank you samsung for making me content with my fold 4.  No desire to &quot;upgrade&quot;.
UgxCZYjoTfWTQUV7zpt4AaABAg,"The Z-Fold is by far the smartphone with the best usability and productivity options, best gaming- and multi-media experience and offers the best innovations.<br>It destroys the heavily antiquated iphones that lack: large screen, DEX, KNOX, S-Pen, file-manager, fingerprint scanner, multi-tasking, multi-window, popup window, taskbar and sooo much more."

UgxE-GS3mIRRf1r1VYl4AaABAg,The Razr is a better flip phone for sure
Ugw8IcCdQCINa9BYeNV4AaABAg,Is this how Apple fans feel? Having to hype themselves up for little to no change?
Ugx_6XtwSVvEA5h17Sx4AaABAg,"So I ore ordered the flip 5 and i see it says it has a built in screen protector, should i leave it on or take it off to replace it when I get it?"
Ugw4Ju1A8bJJliWJRfl4AaABAg,Im just wondering when this flip/fold trend will be forgotten. History turns around.
UgzIKq7IAOaf-6oRSOV4AaABAg,"Im giving up my Fold 4 for the one plus open. Fold 3, 4 and 5 are the same damn phone"
Ugz0sZKbnD12NEsl3_54AaABAg,Samsung freaking settled...
UgydH-bLegRe1DL9kOR4AaABAg,"Thanks...have the Samsung S22 Ultra still and was really hoping the Fold 5 would integrate sPen inside the chassis. I would have immediately pre-ordered it. Not this year for sure for sure..kind of disappointed. Yes that S9 Ultra tablet looks sweet, I still enjoy my S8 Ultra tablet."
Ugw9oBCvOhyWGxgYtCp4AaABAg,"I wonder what apple will release for their next phone , maybe bigger scrren or more camerasüòÇüòÇ"
UgyweSC4Sls7pks2z4F4AaABAg,"I own the fold 4, and the outer display isn&#39;t an issue at all and you get used to it. I had to go back to my note 10+ for a week or so, and missed the one hand usability with the phone, coming from someone with giant hands in the first place."
UgyumqnQYZqlpfDeyh54AaABAg,"Samsung has completed the final act of copying Apple after denouncing them for doing it: tiny changes, a few refinements.<br><br>Microsoft, Surface Duo 3 when? It‚Äôs clear there‚Äôs no more innovation from Samsung in the most innovation-ready area of mobile technology in a decade or anything"
Ugwt63puIzyPhCB84_h4AaABAg,Willl you be talking more about the watches in a different video?
Ugw18GkZHeeekNr3GEx4AaABAg,The subtitles in the last couple videos are super broken. It&#39;s a huge wall of text at the start of the video and then nothing else.

UgyzUWUy0xZYNqYL1Wt4AaABAg,God&#39;s to keep it a 100. Look like I won&#39;t be getting a new phone 2024.
UgwSVBBvu05-mXyZFGp4AaABAg,Makes me feel better for going Pixel Fold instead of waiting for Fold5.
UgwJaNFuUnCactJpRhl4AaABAg,Considering they disnt do much to these phones im glad they did not increase the prices however they could&#39;ve decreassed prices and gotten mode buyers. I wanted a samsung foldable but then i saw moto has there&#39;s and its cooler for cheaper. They could&#39;ve at least given better cameras to these phones or something that made them more worth it other than an outer display and not that noticably faster chip if you had last years devices.
Ugyz_7-274yTk820gaN4AaABAg,"The only one exciting thing from Samsung this year,  are the Tablets"
UgyU9tUCHltSFvVSv1R4AaABAg,"Rocking flip4 for a year now. Tempted to upgrade, but i&#39;ll wait for a better camera and less noticeable crease. Most thing I love so far is the battery life."
UgycOpbNOt5Sci_kQJN4AaABAg,"I&#39;m just happy they&#39;re still doing the $100 to go from flip 4 to flip 5. I don&#39;t use my flip very often but it&#39;s really fun when I do, though ... they didn&#39;t fix the one thing I wanted, which was adding a telephoto lens. And there&#39;s no free case so I guess I&#39;ll have to figure out what&#39;s up with that. C&#39;est la vie. X.x"
Ugxz369v_BvRvEQkTRh4AaABAg,"I&#39;m sorry, but a disappointing video with barely covering anything I wanted to know about the phone. MrMobile does a much better job at these. Unfortunate that he still only has 1/10 of the subscribers"
UgySUPU3sToavRDh3-p4AaABAg,Disappointed. Btw I&#39;m not going to EVEN TRY foldable devices until I&#39;ll  see proper IP68 rate
UgyyUR-VZuZTool479t4AaABAg,Kind of disappointed that Samsung is merely iterating with their folding phones now
Ugx8EhlNC9BztGUH5gJ4AaABAg,fine if they&#39;re leaving majority of previous hardware inside than is it cheaper now?
Ugypxji9wcLup3Kh3XV4AaABAg,"Haha, Motorola Razr wins, glad I did not wait and bought it. Love it so far. Please do not hate me for liking the Razr better. I could be wrong but it seems on the Samsung you only have widgets for the outer display, whereas on the Motorola Razr you can run any app on the external display. Will have to watch other reviews to know for sure. I still like my Razr as it brings back memories to the first ever flip phone the Motorola StarTAC which I still have, it&#39;s not usable of course but still works. Again, all the Samsung fanboys please do not hate me üôÇ"
UgzhgXkrTPda_hF-bwl4AaABAg,Z fold 5 JUNK<br>still with a very narrow outside screen that is unusable and crap
UgxnlmUK2jequ53zAyx4AaABAg,When Samsung originally launched the undercooked flips and folds I reckoned I‚Äôd buy fold by the 7th generation. But it seems now that I‚Äôd have to wait till the 11th or 12th gen üòÇ
UgzPK8HIarAPPUyXt2Z4AaABAg,I can see a reason to not drastically change is to also help the folding phones become established and trusted so people actually buy them instead of the regular phones
UgzJ0MDc8gRi3tkDbZR4AaABAg,I would like to buy Motorola Razr plus instead of Samsung galaxy z flip
UgxiIugD_jFSsDoZ_th4AaABAg,"Lmao Android space is dying, most Android focused YTers get no views"

UgwXHG6FfL2PjhDrlb54AaABAg,"Honestly, the only thing keeping me from buying a fold is the battery life. I understand that both screens will take a toll on the battery. But I was hoping Samsung would have found a revolutionary way to improve battery to true all-day performance. Call it wishful thinking."
UgxNEBsO-E6pflnoQ7F4AaABAg,Honor Magic V2... Moto Razr... why samsung? Why?
Ugzvm-hCz5gXe8L0l154AaABAg,"Well it is the same route that Apple follow after the 12 series, by just changing colour offerings and nothing more.... I would say as an Engineer that they have little room for giant steps at the moment, and slowly when they discover something new finally they will make an impact...To that moment they have to keep it going for themselves and the showrooms and the public. All in all a slow continuation, not bad if you don&#39;t have a flagship phone at the moment to jump to..."

UgwNB_cehapPxM-1w_B4AaABAg,I really don&#39;t get why Samsung try to hype it so much when there are nothing to hype about
UgyGV9976XsAS5it1Cp4AaABAg,The software still isn&#39;t amazing on the Fold 4 and the 5 doesn&#39;t seem like much of an improvement.  Pixel Fold is the closest I&#39;ve used to something that feels right.  I don&#39;t think it will be better until Apple releases something that can fold and switch between iOS and iPadOS (for example).

Ugy_HcevVWTwGs4p_BV4AaABAg,"Maybe they should make a galaxy note fold, or &quot;Galaxy notebook&quot;! Make it a bit more notebook&#39;ish by making it wider, that would also make space for the s-pen. Maybe make the whole thing  even slightly bigger, so it&#39;s even closer to a tablet size when opened. This would be a huge phone but that&#39;s why you&#39;d bring back the &quot;note&quot; name."

Ugwm9_2ll2M5zs8uYAp4AaABAg,I guess they are starting to make the real money now...they need to slow down with the R&amp;D and start making money of it just like Apple every other year with the S models
Ugyuy_S3JAQj0KaoUQp4AaABAg,"damn. i remember the first gen fold came out with all the issues, and we are already at 5th gen... the hinge design has definitely grown well. i can see this being common in coming years. i guess the next goal is to have thinner body, to get single phone&#39;s thickness when folded. and flexible glass screen, instead of plastic."
UgzXa_YmQ2s3TYNvl3B4AaABAg,they really need to give up on these foldables. the tech isn&#39;t ready and these suck

Ugz24ZR3fGiGDdxnXMh4AaABAg,I quite disappointed that they didn&#39;t have any major updates on the fold 5. Looking like this is becoming more of a samsung them like you said mk. I&#39;m on the fold 4 series and was expecting better cameras a s pen built info the the device and a fatter outer display on the fold 5. I just wanted to see major tweaks as samsung use to be.
Ugw47oOiRfr8nRxXauB4AaABAg,"its easy to say They Settled! but Samsung are pioneers. They are getting there and maybe by fold 7 we will have shaved another 3-4mm of the width. Thats when I buy in, these are amazing if you can handle the weight in a daily driver."

You dont complain about a 2022 ferrari when the 2023 ferrari looks identical, you appreciate everything new about it even if its minimal."
Ugxc35cgpP4INRDhdGN4AaABAg,Could you perhaps do a comparison between the motorola phone and this flip 5. I am deciding which is better.
Ugxd1KhhNBlCLdkXfIl4AaABAg,If your phone starts above $699 it should have 256gb base storage. That&#39;s it.
Ugz1Rvf_6J87Jklm5bV4AaABAg,Actually i like the narrow screen. it allows me to hold and type wif the same hand. Also the fact that it now folds flat is reason for me to buy it. <br><br>I am still on a Note 20 Ultra but this Fold 4.5 seems like enough of an upgrade to me. Unless u already have a Fold 4... Then wait till nxt yr...
Ugx0QgkBViuBvp0DssJ4AaABAg,A $94 upgrade cost from a Flip 4 trade-in?  I&#39;ll take it
Ugx80b-_D0yOLt6S-eJ4AaABAg,Why do they keep making the Fold so thin and tall Im sick of it !!!<br>Oppo Find N`s shape is literally what it should be...
Ugxuor8WtBaiFDX08RB4AaABAg,I&#39;ll wait until next year
Ugxvlj5o64gVakdou8J4AaABAg,Attacking apple and now doing the same. Shame on you Samsung
UgyRwxYvO-kn_JChLGx4AaABAg,Like a lot of people in the comment section I&#39;ll be keeping my fold 3. I really hoped Samsung would do more with the 5 but it&#39;s not enough to justify.
UgxCFGmk04TIZ-e4vTx4AaABAg,"You know what they say,&quot; if it not broken don&#39;t fix it. &quot;"
UgwmXlOkcbNaqa0K1YF4AaABAg,will you still be doing proper reviews??
UgyKlW_DAt8WRUkmYb14AaABAg,Bring back the LG Rollable phone
UgxWiyPi5JT5h_e62aV4AaABAg,Day by day they want to sell you shit ! This is samsung and apple now .
Ugx6rcE7l3oMOwy2qD94AaABAg,"So if im brand new to foldables and planning to get one in January, should I just get the fold 4 and save some money?"
UgzBgEccylr9aaL9O2t4AaABAg,Looks like Samsung has run out of ideas
UgwHArENAQXf39nHhfN4AaABAg,I was in mobile sales when the galaxy mega came out.<br><br>People went nuts for it because of the size It was basically a giant S3. The only other phone that was comparable in size to that at the time in the CDMA market was the LG flex. Another company that kind of just tries random shit and sees if it sticks they made a giant phone with a curve display and my selling point on that was to take the phone lay it face down and press the back all the way flat.<br><br>It was a niche market but it slowly grew and popularity and I think Samsung saw that as they put the S4 S5 and s6 out when they did the 6 edge plus you saw the re-emergence of the large phones
Ugx6IpPHpa4Kc7wOmuN4AaABAg,A review of the Tabs would be really nice. I think they improved so much even in app quality
UgyXD9V7L4ZKOcbeV0p4AaABAg,So doing the same thing for minor update versions just like Apple has done for years. And every iSheep on the planet wets themselves over those for some reason.
UgyeJD1Q4TsAvdVD9NF4AaABAg,I was waiting to see what would happen with the flip series before I made up my mind on if I wanted to trade in my flip 3 for the moto razr or get the flip 5. seems like if i want something better than my 3 then the razr would be the one to get. that being said daily driving a ROG 7 has made me kinda forget about my flip 3 entirely so it may just as well just stick around until something exciting comes a long
UgxEdeVCRmspWVmKx-Z4AaABAg,....is Samsung turning the outside screen into a damn normal sized phone????? ughhhh.
UgxS894Tgxz_qpQKQ2Z4AaABAg,I think I&#39;ll stick with my Fold 3 another year......I feel like the 6 is gonna be awesome
UgxWqoDYDYfs120QLbB4AaABAg,Still not convinced this phone is practical or worth the money üòÖ
UgxpxXZ8kk7-kBqlEr54AaABAg,It looks alright. I‚Äôm not into flips very much. I much prefer the fold style. However the pixel fold is way more in line with what I prefer in terms of dimensions and aspect ratios. I‚Äôm gonna wait for apple to release a folding phone before getting one. Every android phone I‚Äôve had for the the past few years have been disappointing. Apple has the candy bar phone down to a science so I‚Äôll stick with them. As much as I prefer the software experience of an android phone.
Ugyt5R5mICsC41yaiax4AaABAg,i was really looking forward to upgrading from my fold 3<br><br>guess ill wait another year
UgyK0Evr081ll05eCK94AaABAg,MKBHD wallpaper app? Is it going to happen? Or am i too late?  ü§î
UgyBSQbc5oyIa6Hc9TV4AaABAg,Do you mean &quot; same exact shit?
Ugw52GnF_upCRSIvpD94AaABAg,"i saw the unpacking this morning...i have the zfold 3 and was keeping hopes high that the zfold 5 would have the pen inside the phone, but since they didnt do it, im done! im just going to upgrade to the zflip 5 instead and just be done with it. this is what happens when you dont listen to your customers about USEFUL upgrades"
Ugws4KNlmfLdMWyqmQh4AaABAg,"Samsung has learned from Apple. If it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it. When competition catches up, then consider upgrading hardware. Constant innovation and market experimentation is risky and costs money."
UgxvjBofR9a5wWeUcVR4AaABAg,Reaction to the Fold 5: üò¥üò¥üò¥
UgwbqMV5IAqqFqwKOqN4AaABAg,The whole foldable thing is not going anywhere until Apple joins in. And Apple will not.
UgxHHAyM40UPM-gvFq94AaABAg,welcome back zfold 3 5g! the recycle! ü§£
UgwrMdvcIOykwxhkh254AaABAg,Debating on flip‚Ä¶ love the new tech.. but love the ultra line‚Ä¶ concerned on screen wear on flip‚Ä¶ would be my only concern‚Ä¶ Apple seems so far behind
UgzB3_sGTNYp9xEkbHl4AaABAg,"I only wanted them to make the front screen bigger, at least. Also, I wish the micro sd card would get added back into phones."
UgxyNg6hOJFOSsyl0H54AaABAg,"I&#39;m rocking a Fold 3 and I think im gonna hold on to it for another year tbh though I hope Samsung keeps the tall 6.2 cover screen, I love how easy it is to use 1 handed, the Pixel was to short and wide for me to enjoy using 1 handed"
UgxYpC6LnSPggjRTYed4AaABAg,same battery is a big no for me
UgyRVKKHORq_9Wt-rnt4AaABAg,Same camera&#39;s  ?  That sucks
UgwBjWSMHK8e9sc1uq54AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m20s"">5:20</a> MKBHD had almost been talking like Filthy Frank. üòÆ"
UgwgiQMyrBSR300YDK94AaABAg,"Have a Fold 4, happy that nothing has changed. Might even try the new case for the smaller S-pen if the camera bump is in the sams place. It really highlights how much a larger handed person would make use of a Fold Plus, XL or Ultra, though, and the upgrades (like an S-pen silo, better battery and better cameras) write themselves."
UgynxnHjEXQlvBRuRIt4AaABAg,Why is everyone shocked about the fold 5. The ceo mentioned it wont be much of a change before the fold 4 even came out. Even said itll prob be the lowest sales
UgwqNTPW9z2nUTM73sZ4AaABAg,"For the price its an obvious no-go, but it&#39;s still interesting to follow samsung."
Ugydb4BRf-6wTotv6Zd4AaABAg,"Classic example of ‚Äúif Samsung was in Apples position, they‚Äôd do the same‚Äù<br>And they did. I guess they realized that most customers don‚Äôt want a completely different phone each generation. They just want it to work"
Ugw9oNSGKBMeRjvqJQF4AaABAg,What‚Äôs the point of foldable phones? I just don‚Äôt get it.
UgzAk62TZGYNKQ3elDZ4AaABAg,"I was initially concerned about the rumors surrounding Samsung&#39;s restriction on using apps like YouTube on the cover display, but I&#39;m relieved to have confirmed that it is available. However, I can&#39;t help but feel a bit disappointed with the innovation showcased in the z flip 5 and fold 5. Samsung has always been a company known for pushing the boundaries and introducing cutting-edge technology, but lately, it seems they are trying too hard to mimic Apple instead of embracing their unique identity as a proud competitor.<br><br>I was hoping to see more color options for the watch 6 classic. Black and silver can get a bit monotonous, and it would have been great to have more variety. Additionally, I expected Samsung to announce a new foldable device, preferably a foldable tablet. This technology has already been showcased at CES, and a tablet that could fold in half, like a tablet ultra, would have been a game-changer.<br><br>My concern is that Samsung&#39;s innovative spirit might be diminishing year over year. Nonetheless, despite my reservations, I&#39;ve decided to trade in my iPhone 14 pro for the cream-colored flip 5 and the watch 6 classic. Since Samsung doesn&#39;t offer the color options I desire, I&#39;ve even purchased a gold plating kit online to customize my watch and add some uniqueness to it. Here&#39;s hoping that Samsung will return to its trailblazing ways in the future."
Ugz4ecs1n3-DKLrCtHV4AaABAg,"I always update phones every 2 years. I&#39;ve been using the Fold 3 since it came out because it felt like the first time one of these phones could last me all day with minimum charging to get through. I was hoping to see a more natural aspect ratio for that outer display, and an internal s pen this year. While the Fold 5 is a good step up from the 3 that I&#39;m using, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s worth it. I might switch to the flagship or even the pixel fold. Idk."
UgxV7RSaXQ8qduS0EZN4AaABAg,hopefully the quick iteration is good news for consumers in that the fold 4 will maybe go down in price since the 5 is being released
UgydevyQ_qyo0c_mRpZ4AaABAg,My zfold 1 has 512GB standard. Hah!
UgzTDOvaVv514ATVTHd4AaABAg,I couldn&#39;t afford one yet still watching for Marques
UgyHm-jXQuCUfzwnYgR4AaABAg,Give me the Flip&#39;s outer screen half and keep the rest
Ugy_eicHl9wS4ZARU7t4AaABAg,Looks like I&#39;ll be keeping my fold 4 because these improvements were so unimpressive
UgyjwDrFjyyJlqA6CSt4AaABAg,Only thing Fold needs is better aspect ratio for video when fold open.
Ugwtnrm7Wpf0MWbAXbZ4AaABAg,Awesome video as always dude. Samsung has been very blah since they hired TM Roh. He cuts costs a lot. The S lineup has been the same for like 3 years. I&#39;m hearing the S24U is going to be the same as the S23U. I&#39;ve been thinking about switching.
UgyhwIBd7T3MQPKQXJd4AaABAg,"Unless you have gigantic hands, the thin form factor is more comfortable than the unwieldy huge pixel fold. Also, most smarthphone content is consumed through scrolling."
UgwN7OzV4X_NVdG-qnl4AaABAg,I expected a note version from day one and now I am confused and disappointed that the s pen is still separated!!!! Why Samsung.........Why ?????? I guess I&#39;ll have to wait for the Z fold 8 or something
UgweKf5NKhu767AsW5x4AaABAg,Can‚Äôt believe I waited for this announcement before deciding between the Motorola Razr 2023 or the Flip 5.. üôÉ.. Motorola it is!
Ugwj7G_yOTqvbuuGbR94AaABAg,Samsung settling with the Z Fold 4 is how I was able to get my Z Fold 4 for so damn cheap. Most people who wanted it already had the Z Fold 3. I had the Note20 Ultra so I got my Z Fold 4 for $1000 with the trade in.
Ugx-y9GEugOTgt68koB4AaABAg,Wouldve been better off calling this 4.5
UgwKA-8LBRFwKdMxlAd4AaABAg,"Yeah, going back to apple. If these guys are gonna do the small, very small upgrades to each years flagships, I mine as well go back to iphone. At least I&#39;ll have iMessage and Facetime like the rest of the world..."
Ugx9Mm2M6QYSJW2qNIN4AaABAg,"sticking with my S23 Ultra no thanks Samsung, I have the Fold 3 and once again meh"
Ugwc4tzBbNmRiw1LcDt4AaABAg,I don‚Äôt understand why it thicker and heavier than s23 but it can‚Äôt put a ‚Äúthinner‚Äù s pen into it . And how come a $1.8k flagship phone still using the outdated camera system and everyone call it ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ? Am I the only one don‚Äôt understand Samsung marketing logic ?
UgzELR_uT6XLmd9uW1V4AaABAg,I think they&#39;re just playing to their strengths. I got to hold the flip 5 last week and I will say it feels more solid than the razr phone but I like the look of the razr much more especially the magenta one
UgyFlnIcOX0psxohxSZ4AaABAg,"Nice to see Samsung hit with healthy competition in the foldable market. Perhaps at some point, they‚Äôll actually be a worthwhile reason to choose their products over Moto Razr+ or Pixel Fold. Yet again, Samsung provides mere incremental upgrades. All they did was forge the Razr+ outer screen and the flat hinge structure for both flip and fold. The Fold 5 is the most disappointing. Better luck next year."
Ugzjm7dO6SSSASSwgMh4AaABAg,"I honestly don&#39;t understand why people like this foldable phones, literally you can see the crease, that&#39;s no appealing at least for me..."
UgwGvPz1f7ff7uBlSoB4AaABAg,The ZFold feels so spy- gadgety when folded and always surprises me with its utility when unfolded.
UgwfSu_U3rSE_50_Qlt4AaABAg,I hope you will review these products‚Ä¶because you didnot review any of the flip/fold samsung phones and watches last year unlike apple products which you review everything
UgyIP8ZuoiVfCI0XdZx4AaABAg,"Coming from the s22u, that hinge change is all I was waiting for. And it has the newest chip? Can&#39;t wait."
Ugwrtg69Y-dBWn-PXFx4AaABAg,This is the moment samsung became OnePlus
Ugz3YfHUd1y9O_IvOQJ4AaABAg,The tab s9 ultra is so nice‚ù§Ô∏è
UgwNuVjF895Ectvgfil4AaABAg,I skip this gen! Very happy with my Z Flip 4.
UgyExKsMTxUuA6DCJX54AaABAg,no pen slot<br>no new battery<br><br>I&#39;ll wait for the Z Fold 6 or 7 ...
UgxgE8qKePcQaS6hbiR4AaABAg,"Truth is Samsung&#39;s innovation has dipped, twas better during DJ Koh, we had lots of futuristic features, even though lots of em fizzled away but a lot stuck and hasn&#39;t changed much since then. I miss DJ Koh"
Ugx8dkRa_saannXhH554AaABAg,They look great. 1800 is still a lot though.
Ugy9pFJXX-7QirMLbLN4AaABAg,I miss my android üò¢
UgxWC9Os0kptx1YZ6r14AaABAg,"They should have made the fold more like the Pixel and other Chinese foldables, a bit shorter and wider so the cover screen is actually usable."
UgwVa-Vtf-UmpwHsTVJ4AaABAg,In Honor Magic V2 era <br>This is a trashy phone
UgwOliEg0Fyp1dL5mcl4AaABAg,"I feel like Apart from Xioami, Samsung end even Google are just really lacking behind when it comes to bubble smooth, bouncy animations, transitions. I feel having amazing transitions when flipping or switching, or pressing or closing a app, sending a message, swiping down the notification bar etc would be the next step Android 14 or 15 should focus on. I&#39;m really getting tired of the &#39;&#39;just good enough&#39;&#39; animations. If Xiaomi and Apple can do it Google and Samsung can do it too."
UgyTkpqE9lwor4fdEyl4AaABAg,Meanwhile applewill release a new color on their new phones and call it a day
UgzC3QRaQIxQSJFrkdl4AaABAg,Leaving this comment as a reminder to check this video again in a decade on 26July2033
Ugxe-7lKJMfdaTr5xWZ4AaABAg,Z Fold 3 looks like we are not getting divorce this year. Still in love with you! Let‚Äôs see what happens next year lol
UgwzhumV2gS1hPcLXMN4AaABAg,You should review the tablet and the watch üëÄ
UgxL_1l7fpszRkUvqXt4AaABAg,"Big time issue with the services they promise. Had a flip 3, officially their declaration says one time screen protector replacement free for the 1st yr. Trust me, the same peals of in 3/4 months, and samsung service guys solve by stating - website mein galat likha hai, pay Rs 800 for the protector change. 3 months pass - Repeat !!!!<br>Email to Samsung- be rest assured-no replies, as they do chest thumping coz of the market base ....<br>Very poor service and unprofessional.<br>AVOID THE GIMMICK !"
UgzGp6g-i7-RtDZKKfJ4AaABAg,"Samsung&#39;s Fold phone intrigues me but I use the Pen and the extra bulk of the Fold case and pen on the outside presents a manageability challenge for me. I might, might be willing to tackle it though if the camera was in line with my S23 Ultra which is the best phone camera I&#39;ve ever used. For 1800.00 I want the best camera."
UgzVqvNnaFvIK_5Z9pt4AaABAg,"As a Fold 4 user, this is a big disappointment.  I was hoping for some real innovation this year.  Usually they do big innovation, and then refinements the next year.  The Fold 4 was a refinement on the Fold 3 and this is just a minor refinement on the Fold 4.  If Samsung was making perfect Folding phones, wouldn&#39;t care.  Can&#39;t beat perfect.  But there are other folding phones coming out now that are superior to what Samsung is doing.  They are losing ground in the market they created.  <br><br>I&#39;m really hoping the Fold 6 is something impressive."
UgyUILhXeio24tPI-Cx4AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m06s"">5:06</a> ahh marques you made a mistake you said flip but the video was fold and after that you said fold but the video was flip"
UgzYpddzFUWIdqt69WZ4AaABAg,Same camera.. let down for me.. gonna wait for next year
Ugy9jnRG3ndkhzTDlcd4AaABAg,If only you were this honest about apple products

Ugwur5VRlq6ZF5J9ysZ4AaABAg,"I have the flip 3 for two years now and still get jealous and suprised looks, I still love using it every day. I also  often change the case and the front screen gifs, so it never gets boring."
UgxjAqLW7iGFp5sICvh4AaABAg,"I would&#39;ve never figure out samsung STILL makes tablets, I honestly thought they left that market, you know because of how the iPad basically DOMINATES that category, its looks nice but I&#39;d still pick up an iPad over it."
UgxQgC8Pu3Xl1o8ratt4AaABAg,Are we already in the 5th iteration?

UgzmMSgorhueiLfBapF4AaABAg,Excuse me but a wallpaper app!
Ugymwwnj2LhFx-ho_0B4AaABAg,"Samsung didn&#39;t invent the &quot;Mega&quot;. They just copied the whole idea from Sony Xperia Z Ultra and made a cheaper larger Galaxy (mega wasn&#39;t a high-end device) to see if people would prefer this larger size, and they did. On the other hand, the company who invented the &quot;Ultra&quot; approach became less and less relevant in consumers&#39; eyes each passing year. The rest is history."
UgyyyjntXs-5fnlmg5h4AaABAg,It&#39;s so sad that LG left the market when they did because their scrollable/expandable phone would have been a different and exciting form factor and I think the best form
UgzsynA911ZeTtWPEbt4AaABAg,"Your transitions out of the intro and into your content, are pretty lame. It‚Äôs the same thing, with you moving your hand away from the lens. You can do better. Home Improvement transition maybe?"
UgwTrOR730udjuwEppN4AaABAg,Rollable displays when?!
UgzN3lc4ym-JoL3UnhV4AaABAg,Why you hate Samsung so much
UgzMvFEv6-n1QpMZXGd4AaABAg,"Loved being a early adopter to folding tech but the Fold 5 looks no different to my old Fold 3, apart from the new processor its barely changed in the last 2 years. Had my Fold 3 for 1.5 years until the folding screen protector started lifting, sent to samsung for warranty repair, repaired, sold on and replaced it with a s22 ultra and never looked back. Not sure how samsung warrant the ¬£1750 price tag when the tech stays the same with each new generation."
UgxAO8_nT1TANLhqFB54AaABAg,"I think the Z Fold 5 is too similar to the Fold 4 and that the Pixel Fold has carved its own segment out of the market, which will hurt Samsung sales. For me the Pixel Fold is worth it for the usable outer screen, plus for free you get a huge battery, great cameras and the Pixel experience. I had the Z Fold 4 but it&#39;s dramatically weaker than the Pixel Fold. No comparison."
UgyB8vsK08bV0DNifsZ4AaABAg,"My expression watching this video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=7m03s"">7:03</a>"
UgxL4VbGumm6QvXaaV54AaABAg,Does the Z Flip 5 still have the issue where the screen protector Samsung installs bubbles up?  I&#39;ve been having that issue with my Z Flip and had to go in repeatedly
Ugwce5H8HSbH8ZX4C394AaABAg,Everyone literally want from samsung to change the form of the outside screen in the fold to be bigger so that we can do everyday things there and then when we want to watch something or work to open it. But they just won&#39;t do it
Ugys_2X6da4_iOAH0p54AaABAg,"Thanks, you&#39;ve saved me watching the Samsung event. So, to sum it up, nothing new for 2023."
UgzsW8VPDHjm2k3Bf0F4AaABAg,It would be siiiick if it had a button that unfolds it on the side.
UgxOXvyrmoG45MJfIix4AaABAg,"Another reviewer stated that the Fold 5 has a new camera sensor, can you confirm this.."
UgwyUqPc99i-nuPu9Dt4AaABAg,"&quot;They changed nothing except the hinge, chip and cover display&quot; bro what else were you expecting?"
Ugx3bwgJmoHokglum-J4AaABAg,"devils advicate for a second... This year the upgrade has been so incremental, because next year they are going to have a major one. Samsung just need more than a year to make that happen.<br><br><br>Hopefully :)"
UgwzeEW6SUhK3ZRUY4J4AaABAg,I hope to myself to not purchase a Z Fold 5. I just got my S23 Ultra since launch!

UgwXL0ZmWuEdeRU5z6J4AaABAg,"If Samsung were listening to me, the Fold 5 would have come this year with a wider front screen which would have made room for a slot for the S Pen and a higher capacity battery, plus a dust resistance rating. I will wait to see what happens next year."
UgzCKx7uwLJ-2osbwOJ4AaABAg,Saying Samsung has settled in the foldable space and saying nothing when Apple hasn&#39;t done anything new since the iPhone X is wild.
UgzBicN3HqCfGEfqxKN4AaABAg,The new motorola razr+ seems much more impressive than the new Flip 5
UgzLRMbFxJCpmG9sAbp4AaABAg,"Really sad to see the lack of improvement. The Fold feels like an afterthought to the S series. I was really hoping for that 10x optical zoom camera from the S23 Ultra (and heck, the S22 Ultra as well). In any case, this was a wonderfully descriptive yet concise explainer. Thank you good sir, keep up the amazing content."

UgzKVD-jqqZxSFDYo854AaABAg,"Disappointed. Same everything with minor upgrades. Processor and hinge are the only upgrades. the outer screen is almost unusable. I wish Samsung would have enabled fold horizontally that would give bigger and wider outerscreen. Having used fold 3 and 4, I am not planning on upgrading this year. Waiting for iphone fold !!!"

UgytH27GlbX61L5XI_14AaABAg,"Marquees, I personally don‚Äôt agree with ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve just settled on the form factor and thats it‚Äù. Improving the cameras (specially the front one that looks unusable for a 1.8K USD phone) doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with changing the form factor. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I agree on the form factor they‚Äôre using, but if they‚Äôre gonna charge you that much money they should make bigger upgrades YTY."
UgzPUSO8Hj6pPR2PqHN4AaABAg,What was the point....
UgzI8iCds1-HOnFbBOx4AaABAg,What about the screen durability? They say they break over time or get easily damaged.
UgwWFh5ku3wLQ3dCtV54AaABAg,So boring i&#39;ll stick with my zf3 nothing changedüòÇ samsung do better
UgwGmJYGy-WI4Od7-Ed4AaABAg,So there‚Äôs not necessarily to upgrade fold 4 to fold 5 - except the hinge
UgwIB5pka9t5tEqXMLN4AaABAg,Crazy that the outside screen on the Flip is nearly the same screen size as the first few iPhones.
UgzCKi_t-ajhSXbDLQx4AaABAg,Seeing Samsung slow down on a year to year basis is nice.
UgweMPvdvl2gnTumjIp4AaABAg,the audacity to price it at 1799? nice try samsung trendsetting it at ridiculous price same technique<br>apple used on iphoneX years ago
Ugw8DYzRaCTSXdNa3yB4AaABAg,"It&#39;s funny how it&#39;s only been 6 years since folding phones have been a thing, and they&#39;ve already plateau&#39;d in bold new features, which took regular smartphones over a decade to achieve."
UgxjEBUcsKkDh5vO7-d4AaABAg,I have a z fold 4 and after spending a few minutes with the pixel fold I wish they had changed the design
UgwXV6qn1Zp_bd7WLNp4AaABAg,"If they put the S23U&#39;s cameras (except the 3x zoom, which is pretty useless) into the Z Fold 5, it would be incredible. But because they haven&#39;t, you have to again choose between the best camera or more screen.<br><br>The same under screen camera isn&#39;t too much of a problem, it&#39;s mostly for video calls."
UgzNJwJO9HIAus_NdfF4AaABAg,10 years ago i was soooo excited for the galaxy S4 üò¢
UgyiX1R-KPMEHXKQ6fV4AaABAg,"I am not confident to go for Fold 5 as I type a lot. Front screen is too small for me to type and big screen is too big (Need both hands). Else I would have gone for Fold series long back. This time, I will explore s9 Ultra Tab for sure :) Love Samsung anyways."
UgzZOZLYh2tWOfcWj7l4AaABAg,"Until they add an integrated S Pen, I will not buy. Hopefully next year."
Ugxe0yl_CrVcMMxgzGZ4AaABAg,"Well same as Apple ,,,they don‚Äôt change much either"
UgwaIfSASZYxa4nx04V4AaABAg,Samsung is doing the Apple Way!
UgwYko302Ols-rVtmht4AaABAg,same same &amp; same but price increase
Ugw9O2cgTbGQkmXWQoB4AaABAg,Ordering my first fold!! Been wanting one since the first. Finally gonna send it. I&#39;m excited
UgzQYAOHKJ_DUu_21op4AaABAg,The Apple-ification of Samsung is real üòÆ‚Äçüí®
Ugxo79QdWQi3du6SgBB4AaABAg,Hmm so they did what Apple does every year.
UgzShl7HF7u8IyntEFt4AaABAg,"I&#39;m totally with you on the width when folded been saying it for years now needs to be wider thats why I sent back the fold 2 and 4, but looks like I&#39;ll be saving my money until the 6 next year."
UgzP-IAHhkRPHgoeqPl4AaABAg,"There were so few changes, that he had to include other things in the video to make it decent long video. LOL"
UgyoW6lWnDZZm2oESOd4AaABAg,MKBHD the type of guy to make an 8 minutes video to say &quot;it&#39;s the same as last year&quot;
UgwyiyswCtJOd_QFgLZ4AaABAg,"If only they could make it thin like the honor magic V2. For 1700 I would expect innovation but like you said, they settled."
Ugwqq62f8GkuJp844tx4AaABAg,I loved fold but after use of a year its over rated its just gimmick now dont like that series anymore. Regular brick  phone is what feels solid and useable.
UgxL-lHzeX-Mm_OEFSN4AaABAg,"Folding phones are such a small market now, we only have expensive models like Z Flip and Z Fold. I&#39;m interested in seeing how &quot;budget foldables&quot; will be a thing. Maybe just one mediocre back camera, cut inside camera (not under the display)... I don&#39;t know. Amazing to see how the tech evolves and we&#39;ll have so many different options in the future."
UgwZARUyyjIH6A5qU6J4AaABAg,"I do really enjoy tall aspect ratio, so comfortable to use in one hand. Should work on inner screen reliability and battery"
Ugy2xJeWpFwu06Mu-454AaABAg,They SETTLED because we&#39;re in a recession...
Ugyv1MEkmOJZxiCSXJl4AaABAg,man please send me the flip phone i cant use my iphone 7 anymore
UgyqdC9LuC1FCTMZMUl4AaABAg,So gutted how little has upgraded. I wanted to upgrade my fold 4 but there is zero point. All I wanted was a slightly wider phone and I&#39;d be set but the exact same phone lol
Ugw4im7GNzz3j8kKMjZ4AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=7m06s"">7:06</a> apt reaction for selfie camera"
UgxkROJ4UZEHGBngGWh4AaABAg,For $1800 you&#39;d really expect to get flagship cameras... I have S23 Ultra because of the cameras and S-Pen. Put those into a Fold and I&#39;ll never buy another phone
UgyN49YGy3lSwtPFTZN4AaABAg,"I like the watch 6 classic but to be honest, as a sports and outdoor enthusiast, i was hoping for a Watch 6 Pro with an even improved battery lifeüò≠üò≠üò≠."
UgxCtSv4O9bF_IuxDvJ4AaABAg,This means Samsung gave up on the Chinese market and knows it has no competition in the west. Every Chinese foldable that copied Samsung&#39;s original design is now vastly superior to the Fold 5. E.g: Honor Magic V2 which is only 9.9mm thin!
UgxFTbJxl6LJEScteIl4AaABAg,"As you said, I wish the camera was like the 23. That&#39;s what&#39;s keeping me from getting it."
UgzWgDNBUP67dlFsqzd4AaABAg,This same youtuber will shower love on the 10 year old design of the iphone 15 in September as if it has changed the world.<br>Paid hypocrisy

UgxqbAPPkZbanwTN8-54AaABAg,Is Samsung the new Apple
Ugybp3O2UjL74Ofl6NB4AaABAg,"unless samsung comes with some wild aggressive pricing or trade values on the fold 5 ,, man they are gonna see terrible numbers. They actually  have competition in the US now they have better designs. Its mindboggling why they havent listened to consumers about the fold design and just keeps releasing the same exact phone"
Ugzhg5shqQQ95jpg9Lp4AaABAg,"Nothing about these new Samsung phones are that impressive imo, It&#39;s pretty meh<br>Maybe wait till next year for the next Samsung :/"
UgxomK2Zphd9eAWLX2Z4AaABAg,"That&#39;s called innovation at apple office - no change, üíØ branding üòÇ"
Ugy6I2BvLxCBjPFc7SZ4AaABAg,"I&#39;m actually pretty happy about this - means I don&#39;t have to feel bad at all about keeping my Z Fold 4, as the only things I&#39;d like an improvemnt on would be an S23 Ultra level camera, better battery and for it to be a lot thinner when folded, which it seems is not the case at all with the Fold 5."
UgwsV3fkr6RuAJciz714AaABAg,I think we need a full review on the S9 tab series
UgyrANoOYFtEwbqMKQt4AaABAg,"All i ask for in the fold is to have the same outer screen as the s23 ultra thats it, everything else can be the same and it would be the phone to get ."
Ugxn_fNj3_t6lQEacZV4AaABAg,Folding phones is the epitome of ‚Äúdoing it because we can.‚Äù
UgwY_Hv8ZiDiy79ZL8p4AaABAg,Haha wonderful
UgxvCHcbrsEAWk43AL14AaABAg,Waiting for the foldable smartwatch to hit the market
UgwbbKvnXkv9A64_w214AaABAg,Might get fold 4 if it&#39;s not worth it. Will see

UgyKpsN6K1_YoGHG6GF4AaABAg,they couldn&#39;t even be bothered to follow the design language on the cameras from the 23 series
UgzLyWx9Y6uktHVwWVh4AaABAg,"Until Apple drops something folding, Samsung won&#39;t drop anything new."
UgyisaY3WVNLJJQo97N4AaABAg,I&#39;ll be passing and wait to see what OnePlus comes up with their foldable. My Pixel Fold is doing just fine.
UgyiTqXE_RBERMRRvvx4AaABAg,I remember the phablet era omg
UgxzHR-n5YlGu1octy94AaABAg,"I have the Z flip 3 for almost two years now, 5 is still not worth the upgrade imo."
Ugw5rq-wbP7lpJSz32d4AaABAg,I&#39;m a little disappointed the cameras are the same as last year. I was hoping to replace my fold 3 to 5. Well 1 more year have to do
UgzTI5LSRmcHmgWkhEZ4AaABAg,"The tough reality to overcome is that Motorola up and allowed apps to run on their Flip phone&#39;s smaller screen.  The Samsung is basically stuck to glorified widgets ... hope they optimize some main apps, at least.  Motorola stole their thunder."
UgyJ12GVgNrW_5yo1vl4AaABAg,Seems like at this point Sammy is just refining the two models for longevity/durability since they were so far ahead in the foldable market. MKBHD can‚Äôt miss
UgzzZtVKx0Ojr5uk15x4AaABAg,"Yes, but does the z flip still have a pre installed screen protector that gets messed up within a month or two that voids warranty when you take it o ff?"
UgyTDYz28DKFFTDz_g14AaABAg,ill just wait for the zfold 6... i already have the zfold4 and it gets better each release

Ugz2L3-blW3gPTJLkiZ4AaABAg,"Waiting for price cuts, 5 iterations later and I still haven‚Äôt seen anyone with a foldable in public."
Ugxh2H-GGb-BALdwxSV4AaABAg,"Didn&#39;t you forgott something? At the event they told, that the Flip5 has a completely new Display inside... it has one complete layer additional to strengenth the Display. Sure, i have no idea if this is relevant for the daily use, but it&#39;s a change you did not mentioned."
UgyJKSHYnWSlMGkTjdV4AaABAg,Z Fold 5 is SUPER boring. I really hope Samsung just makes a passport style foldable instead.
UgyVgAO2fdXV8qIAX8d4AaABAg,Repair shops here has a ton of these folding phones. Very fragile I don&#39;t know why ppl buying it. It does look cool but you better babysit that thing.
UgzTvGtYXB4LvAiBQcZ4AaABAg,Samsung have definitely settled. Where&#39;s the improvement üòÇ
UgzbPLh0ANUvhX1loO54AaABAg,Personally I really want to try out the fold but at an 1800 price point and it&#39;s not on par with the s23 ultra is a huge red flag for me
UgzWrKoZT_pWaHm0rM54AaABAg,Until they put the pen inside the fold I see no reason to upgrade my S22 ultra
UgwhEWGYZoROb-UDdLp4AaABAg,"I&#39;ll buy z fold when it gets as thin as a iPhone, that&#39;ll be serving it&#39;s true purpose."
UgyxwChEyV36GMsmFzp4AaABAg,A comment
UgwD248fQ2Wcop3FZCh4AaABAg,The color of the Fold there is really beautiful. Love it
UgxS6obUJPz1KMgLEGR4AaABAg,5 years of folding phones and they aren&#39;t getting any cheaper as predicted. I want to try it but not when I can get a non folding phone with the same internal specs for half the price
UgzIFRQnPZip-W0YfeV4AaABAg,How many people are watching this on there LG Wing phone ?
UgyukRVCEcvf70wod2h4AaABAg,"3 fold phone will be nice. and a flat camera at the back, right? and a better battery life. sweet, modern, sleek and  fun. with expandable storage will be great"
UgyRxycNovINJtd3XAF4AaABAg,"They basically can‚Äôt add anything else that I personally can think of so I only expected small updated to both phones, but I‚Äôm more inclined to care about software now that seem to have nailed the hardware"
Ugy3_xvpkk1JX-pxsHh4AaABAg,so are we gonna see like 10 thousand memes about how they&#39;re the same phones as the last gen like when apple releases a new phone?
UgxCai6ruODCVyz6HYl4AaABAg,are there phone cases for these phones or would that never work?
UgyAp4bA8yUsIQxDb7l4AaABAg,"I&#39;m switching to the flip, that small screen is going to be more than enough to listen to music, navigate the map and phone calls through out the day. I don&#39;t watch titoks so the only time I&#39;ll use the main screen is at night in bed. Plus I hate pulling out my s21u  while walking on the street because of it size, it&#39;ll be a nice upgrade for me hopefully"
Ugyb8t3Ru7xQcSqyOet4AaABAg,I was going to pre-order until I noticed they didn&#39;t change the cameras or much beyond the flatness. I am honestly disappointed I was stoked to be ordering this morning.
Ugw9wqjQPHMBleCZdTF4AaABAg,I have the Fold 3 and been waiting to upgrade but i get disappointed every year.  All i need them to do is make a NOTE FOLD!!!! Same height but wider with the S pen built in......... Thats it @samsung
UgzyI1_zXaNvAyogUwF4AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m07s"">5:07</a> You mean to say 1.Fold 2. Flips 3.Others. Editing Mistake"
UgyjnZ56w0t68MZmCdl4AaABAg,That t-shirt screams for a hanger. ü´∂üèº
UgwnCD_XvEg83jhR12x4AaABAg,"Fold is cool but still too expensive, I&#39;m more interested in the physical bezel on the watch 6 classic."
UgwjlS73wcZL7yaWg9l4AaABAg,Don‚Äôt care for the z food 5 especially for the price but I preordered the z flip 5 and can‚Äôt wait!
UgzaECLbMvMDIU5VdAh4AaABAg,"Welp, I guess I have to wait to see what that One Plus is going to look like. Please be great."
UgwVpqdbWzm7SSvhB4x4AaABAg,‚ô•‚ô•
UgwrFruoVo7eabngtdl4AaABAg,Flip&#39;s front looks like the back of an old Land Rover Discovery!
UgzkysZ4aX3LlhC8zfV4AaABAg,"Until folding phones comes with screens that can withstand atleast 5 in Mohs scale, there is no point of getting these.<br>Phones now a days get abused heavily"
UgwajXyJokO5b7Q5HXl4AaABAg,That front screen is disappointing after the razr
UgwevpP7PmZY449km6R4AaABAg,I use the fold 4 - it is awesome. I never really need to use the outside screen as really I can turn into a mini pad in one hand and off you go. The gap doesnt bother me. Sure is they reduced that it will be cool as smaller. It is just premium build premium software and the cameras external rock too. Its a mimi computer in your pocket. The flip is for ladies :)
Ugz5hHOsdPxmuFuX8Tl4AaABAg,Remember we had things called PHABLETS?!
UgxT2sICCcum7GR_2d14AaABAg,How are we already at the 5th generation of these things lol Does time have somewhere to be?!
Ugx3l1r4alVz1aCqN1h4AaABAg,The tall outside screen is for manhwa
UgwIwlxcE0axTJ5zWyJ4AaABAg,Crazy how fast technology advances‚Ä¶.
UgwQC2RgwLwUWl-iL0x4AaABAg,Would have loved a wider screen. Especially the front screen just felt super odd to use coming from basically any other smartphone.
UgydsdyEc5B4jg1M3Lx4AaABAg,I&#39;m just not interested in Samsung anymore...IMO everything Pixel is doing and they direction they are heading is better.
Ugy1vPeEkJ3s6uLC9a14AaABAg,"I went with the S22 Ultra at the end of last year and was mildly regretting not getting a Fold, but now the idea of waiting for the Fold 6 or maybe even Fold 7 before taking it on as a daily driver sounds more appealing"
UgzwbTHcLt8xDPxfaSh4AaABAg,Marques can we get a full video on the tablet?

UgxWwSW0sSuB9feSOe54AaABAg,"this is kinda strange, especially while google is cooperating with samsung on devices. in this case, looks like samsung wants to see how pixel fold will compete with it. or are they going to &quot;give&quot; this market to google? i don&#39;t think so..."
Ugx6kewXvQYMiRjDvnV4AaABAg,Shame is a fucking green bubble phone
UgyOQ63sqBX56ZpXLNh4AaABAg,"I wanted the Pixel fold because of the form factor and camera but the Tensor 2 and price made me reconsider. I&#39;m not a fan of the Sammy Fold outer screen but everything else about it is a yes. Now I&#39;m twiddling my thumbs waiting for the 1+ Open reviews. At this point Sammy will still give me a decent trade in for my S21 Ultra so I may end up with the Fold 5 as trade bait for hopefully a vastly improved Google Fold 2 or Sammy finally including the Spen and changing the form factor next year. All I know is I&#39;m ready to drop candy bar phones as my daily driver, the mid range market is great currently as a backup phone for places like the beach, camping and amusement parks."
UgwzUiBZzitUg9wcvMt4AaABAg,They&#39;ve settled...to some degree i would say
UgwSd1-X3jPQVYwlW5V4AaABAg,Please do a review for the regular Tab s9 because not everyone loves the ultra due to its sheer size and portability.
Ugypvu27vb3DwvIKYBh4AaABAg,I literally wanted to kill myself when I saw that notch on ths Samsung Tablet.

UgwXERH12aPT1yx23hh4AaABAg,Should I just get the flip 4 then?
UgyJLVgLGCeHtLdwaHx4AaABAg,"All they needed to do was to make a place to store the pen inside the fold, and it would have been enough."
UgwvIkb9Np-61oOP0lR4AaABAg,The one thing I was really hoping for was improvements to that under display camera bc I really wanna see that on more phones
UgxdJXKlTrQE0oZLq914AaABAg,Z flip = poor<br><br>Z fold = $$$<br><br>Any other non IPhone = Smart
Ugxgia6MUFQPGE7B1CR4AaABAg,until they find a solution to the visible crease this tech remain a niche
Ugw1rMbRmoZ--D1sRMV4AaABAg,I have fold 4 and not getting fold 5 or S23 ultra.

UgzwAarz_8s5PblF1c14AaABAg,"Still the same phone, samsung is become apple after all these year."
Ugw-McPOwIeeHHYOb614AaABAg,Compare to honor magic v2 is nowhere close..
UgxUJyykoo8KgwXjYax4AaABAg,"So pretty much, if you want the new phones and don&#39;t already have a Fold or Flip 4. There&#39;s literally no reason to upgrade. <br><br>Reason why I think there is, is because there&#39;s literally nothing right now that companies can do to innovate on phones right now. I mean not unless they can somehow make 8k resolution screens which 8k is literally not mainstream or really supported by anything right now."
UgzsxVdhEZ60JIA8dSV4AaABAg,Huge F for Sammy
Ugzik-8jXTM0Voz6hbJ4AaABAg,RIP apple
Ugwb4cHGJ_6FLxkIv154AaABAg,The Fold feature isn&#39;t dope enough for the camera NOT to be at least = to the S23 Ultra - that&#39;s legit all I was looking for with the 5 and that would&#39;ve been my push to getting it. Keeping the S23 ULTRA.. obviously.
UgzHO1uyIqXl1H18Krd4AaABAg,Z fold 5 is the most disappointing one for me. Cameras and Same outer displays. Not worth 1799 again. Waiting for Oneplus
Ugx_mrGX_oz-Ik_bEHB4AaABAg,i use my s22. was eagerly awaiting the flip 5 but since the crease is still there then maybe next year
UgyV9_2U87BpqOpNaOh4AaABAg,"I love the flip and fold phones but they are a bit too pricey. I am waiting for the Xiaomis, Vivos to make a more affordable version of these so I can have one."
Ugypt1N0I5MM-FHzAbV4AaABAg,"Honestly, companies like Samsung needs to bring foldables(not flip) to the masses with prices in the early 1000s(like 1200 or even below 1000). Just my personal thoughts if they want them to be mainstream like smartphones did over the last 20 years and especially the last 10 years"
UgyPEXXyl_YlCxo9xFJ4AaABAg,Samsung is getting complacent. Apple non innovative ways is making Samsung lazy. Apple with the constant camera upgrade with no other innovation and seeing Apple fans flock to it is making Samsung very non innovative now.
UgxI1vbTlKoNUnzBzyB4AaABAg,"Please, stop with the stupid flip phones. A nice noticeable crease in the middle? Yea you enjoy that! I will stick with my iPhone 14 Pro with my superior ecosystem, simple design, better resale value and long term relevancy."
UgwI94a4CRDocmEqk094AaABAg,Razr ultra is the king for flip phone now.
UgxSpSCUZNIyyi9bw4R4AaABAg,Only good thing about the new release is that the fold 4 price will be coming down.
UgwmHPoB6-g5_MxM0el4AaABAg,12fps &gt; 30fps
UgyqAkGuoUzb_6f1euh4AaABAg,"Because Samsung is trying to be like Apple and screw over its customers like Apple does its customers with upgrades. I&#39;m moving away from Samsung. <br>I&#39;m getting the Motorola Razr Plus, and for my Fold I&#39;m going with Google Fold or the  Honor Magic V2. <br>I like phones to be exciting and new, and Samsung has failed to do that with its minor upgrades. <br>Samsung thinks it&#39;s customers base is brainwashed like Apple customers, and you can give them minor upgrades for years and just change the color of the phones and think they got something special. <br>Well, Samsung customers are not in a cult like Apple customers. <br>We want major upgrades for our money. So Bye-bye Samsung."
Ugwn8vJayDkqpDX0vFV4AaABAg,He complained about the price and took the last year fold silently. It&#39;s a kind of message to stick with old one.
UgxLePQKyubHRL0Jwh54AaABAg,Is the end coming closer for poor Samsung now that they&#39;ve settled? ü§≠
UgzFlVLM-XG7A5tAwi14AaABAg,I&#39;d easily pay 2200-2400 for a galaxy fold ultra that is basically the size of 2 6.7 inch note 10 ultra&#39;s put together with up to date specs. But Samsung is playing too much.
Ugyes7xFpVJgIT9-_Rt4AaABAg,Same Specs as last year. Only thing that is new is a new hinge and the phone got thinner. Samsung only upgraded the Flip 5 because the Motorola Razr exist. They only Upgraded the Fold 5 hinge because the Pixel Fold has the hinge that closes flat with no gap. So Samsung only changed one thing per phone to barely complete with It&#39;s new Competition.
UgzmnF6MA9j9Cs1qe-x4AaABAg,"So just yesterday I&#39;m at the clinic getting my pre employment physical and drug test for my second job and in the waiting area, I pulled out my Z fold 2 and as always the guy sitting next to me started asking about my fold device and I gave him the spiel and how I had my device now three years and as always they&#39;re impressed. That&#39;s a not brag but just a simple observation that even in 2023, unless you own one, no one else knows (nor really cares if I can be frank) the difference between any of these fold devices with a case on or off. I own two folds and until the batteries can no longer hold a charge on either device, I&#39;m done with phone purchases no matter how latest the lastest device is."
Ugwx-9ceFYzzLo76uVx4AaABAg,The update should have been on the PRICE tbh. 1800$ starting price is outrageous!
Ugwuql74_nlycGdPVzV4AaABAg,I am into the fold for the tall outside screen. I have small hands this is the first phone I can actually type with one hand. Any bigger and I need a second on on the other side of the phone to reach buttons on both sides
Ugz1dKaV2qrswjKa7cF4AaABAg,"I still don&#39;t see any problem of them settling..<br>In my country we have a saying that <br>&quot;You don&#39;t change the winning team&quot;<br>So, why would they change some technology that&#39;s in development yet...?"
UgwYOLFIl20WY2P2b-54AaABAg,5th gen foldables are basically the same as 1st gen. Foldables aren‚Äôt and have never been the future. In 5 years from now they will be completely dead.
UgzmeWRfT5mgXw8Ld1R4AaABAg,"Doesn&#39;t the new Z Flip 5 work with Dex? That&#39;s new, right?"
Ugy2UkYRYYJ3p8h1r8R4AaABAg,I&#39;m kind of disappointed. I never wanted a Samsung phone review to sound like an iphone review. üò¢Y&#39;all got one more year to impress me.... Imma get that watch though. üòÇ
Ugxn3RvwZDzleGuu3AZ4AaABAg,Skip a fold 5 get the pixel fold üëçüèº
UgyBbPHXJxSdv3mgZYd4AaABAg,"Same same but different, this is why we need to have more competitors in the global level for flipping and folding phone."
Ugwh9kG-5Xgm4GngBWB4AaABAg,samsung refuses to change that form factor. hopefully google getting into foldables will push them to do more
UgyoA-mLAAEhKtBsYON4AaABAg,"Maybe the reason is obvious or maybe not idk,<br>But why are big companies like Samsung and Apple settling down wrt innovation and design ?<br>If a smartphone looks very similar to the previous gen, might as well skip the launch for that year and launch something more attractive the next year"
Ugz823zFJUAHunHmgK14AaABAg,I&#39;m happy with my iphone SE 2020 with home button and fat bezels. I don&#39;t need gimmicks - just a phone that works perfectly from day one to year 6.
UgyvVBn5ClE-FmDpAGt4AaABAg,I like how he freaks out about apple but Samsung is meh to him lol.
UgyRmvhLVnxjSAPBffZ4AaABAg,I think ill upgrade from my s23+ to a fold 6 or 7 i think
UgwHMSPq1fzzP55VtDl4AaABAg,Samsung has gotten too comfortable with the folding devices. They need to change it up next year bc competition are catching up quick.
UgxyYc-gTtxEj0x-Gq14AaABAg,I own a flip3 and will likely be trading it in for this. Love my current one but its been a couple years so definitely down to upgrade
Ugw8Ga-HOZ455S5qVhZ4AaABAg,Wish there was a samsung version of that crazy xiaomi fold phone - the mi mix fold 2
Ugxu_kOmwnV8HhCLhBp4AaABAg,Folding phone is just shit! That‚Äôs why apple doesn‚Äôt have one.
UgyTKYd55AfPOeAi6TZ4AaABAg,Can the front screen open any app like motorola? Watch videos and open Netflix etc?
Ugy3PXcrTB0lf2dx55N4AaABAg,I would prefer the Motorola Razr but the camera needs to be improved
Ugwn4rKo-bmnmr_eU9l4AaABAg,Once they get rid of that crease in the center then I&#39;ll buy fold 5
UgxX7CbmnMwv4WfnSF54AaABAg,Please do a review of the new tablet. It looks so nice
Ugxniz-8zTaQX9f_hjJ4AaABAg,"Probably the wrong place to ask, but has anyone else had a problem with the fold 4 saying there&#39;s no sim inserted when the screen is unfolded? I&#39;ve tried everything and I think it&#39;s done for. I still owe over $800 on it before I can trade it in. üòÖ"
UgyAjwwELyIDW8R6Rop4AaABAg,The flip 5 is a throwback to the Blackberry Bold 9930 days. Minus they full keyboard of course.
Ugzp-xxZUCI6qU3DNSV4AaABAg,I have a fold 4 and I&#39;m fine with not much change. Theres not much more that needs to be done. Having a 4 the only thing I actually wanted was 4 things: moving the inside camera tona place that makes more sense when you have the phone folded out and on its side like you would have it using the stand that comes with the Samsung case; better camera array on the back; the phone needs to fold flat; small software improvement. <br><br>They&#39;ve done two of them so far. This device has really matured since the fold 1 and there&#39;s not really much more that needs doing.
UgxGSHCfvALTgkd41tZ4AaABAg,"Fold 4 turned out to be a Fold 5 that folds flat with no gap. It&#39;s the same phone. They moved the Rear Camera light and rearranged the words on the website but it&#39;s the same phone. Samsung thinks it&#39;s Customers are Dumb... Smh ü§¶üèæ I&#39;m so glad I got the Google Pixel Fold. If you are still Samsung Only Fans, then get you a Z Fold 4 and save money."
UgzUQCoXMMWe7CUUn3x4AaABAg,Not going to upgrade from z fold 4
UgwiMfoD6pZcZ_W9YyB4AaABAg,"So, just take a step back... Why is a foldable phone better than a flat one?<br><br>As far as I can see, it&#39;s simply different not necessarily better?"
UgxFkMnZhp3A9xW9bBJ4AaABAg,Always look forward to watching and listening to all your videos.  You are a pleasure to listen to and you do them all so well.  My go to.  Thank you!!!!
UgzIBQWhEwZDyhT25lV4AaABAg,I&#39;ve been subbed to this channel for years. never watched a single video
UgyR7iU6t-3U5-pukod4AaABAg,It would&#39;ve been nice to see a 10x optical zoom on the Fold 5.
UgzU6mo6chPufmabm_F4AaABAg,Imagine the z fold/flip 6 be like ‚Äúall the features are the same except for the name‚Äù and people be like ‚Äúshut up and take our moneyüòÇ
UgyvFB7zRvxbg8byjv54AaABAg,Not a knock on Samsung or Google or Apple. We are in the generation of iterative updates when it comes to phones. I do wish the price was cheaper on the Fold or there was more value to buy one. I don&#39;t see a need to buy a foldable phone.
Ugx8QCpnh1dcpNHjjlJ4AaABAg,Whole Phone market is settle now. Nothing new. <br><br>Old wine in new bottle.
Ugx5hzTmsfUK86o7XDR4AaABAg,should i upgrade from my flip 3? from features perspective?
UgwlY-6YDWOKqnKE9l54AaABAg,"i&#39;m disappointed that samsung are doing this. They should just not release a new phone for that year then. Take your time, but make the next product a huge improvement. It would even generate more buzz and hype and others will follow."
UgxmgWr_cvkrDWSu7Sd4AaABAg,"Thanks for releasing this right on time! I am not at all impressed with Samsung&#39;s complacency with the Fold 5. It takes a lot of arrogance to not budge on cameras, battery, etc when Honor has made such advancements in their new foldable, along with every other phone maker. And here in Canada, they did NOT keep the price the same. They raised the 256 GB by $100 and the 512 GB by $159. They were afraid to raise the price in the US market but don&#39;t care at all about minor markets like Canada and other European countries. I see the exact same attitude from other Korean companies like Genesis...pulling many features from the Canadian market. Not a good trend. Anyway, I&#39;m probably going to buy one because I decided this is the year to buy a foldable since I don&#39;t have one now. Buying this one makes me feel a little dirty...like I&#39;ve been swindled a bit. Can&#39;t shake that feeling. But since Google also doesn&#39;t care about the Canadian market, that isn&#39;t an option either. Guess I&#39;m stuck. My only big decision now is...black or blue?"
UgzXDRWiR4zwp-TWaQF4AaABAg,Y couldn&#39;t they just put a pen dock on the Fold 5
UgzSoJXeFF9nGVW96F94AaABAg,Time to keep an eye on@JerryRigEverything to see how well this will hold up compared to the new Razr.
UgwnHjylbauphukm_414AaABAg,I have the fold 4 and glad it didnt really change for the 5. Its very expensive but its a phone you keep for multiple years.
Ugwq8c6RdxqHjacFDiZ4AaABAg,I would never see a video from you about Apple that says they&#39;ve settled. Which has been the Iphone for the last 5 years. Like please give up the bias.
UgyKPp77u7lj66dJJB54AaABAg,I think Samsung is definitely settling into their kingdom of folds and flips. I think it&#39;s fine and they don&#39;t have to throw everything at the wall to see what sticks because that&#39;s what Android as a whole is for. We see Xaiomi and Oppo try everything under the sun and that&#39;s fine. Samsung and Google are going up against Apple and Apple&#39;s locked ecosystem so reliability matters the absolute most in the U.S. right now.
Ugwzql8W0rIi9gHsOkV4AaABAg,My God you&#39;re the best
Ugxccn33_a_3RCt14IJ4AaABAg,"samsung should launch their phones other then &quot;S&quot; series with different company name.  if samsung keeps launching cheap and expensive phones of same design, how will anyone feel different after buying their &quot;S&quot; serires. this is the problem that samsung has put on themselves. or if any budget phone launches, it should be totally different from their expensive phones."
UgzM62TgcBXEYYUGa694AaABAg,When explaining the difference i thought its a parody as nothing major update comes in new launches nowadays. They are all alike‚Ä¶
UgzIzoTzTkFSSI0ZUoh4AaABAg,"And for Apple, it&#39;s the very same old storyüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
UgynCPKGBJygePCa2Dd4AaABAg,Seems like I got a deal since I got the fold and flip on sale price??? Please tell me I‚Äôm good haha
Ugw7SEXFMGwc6Euppv94AaABAg,Boorriinnggggg
Ugxq-lZeJIBWhmmW0rd4AaABAg,I would like samsung to tweak the size of fold just a little. But the 5 doesn&#39;t present an big enough jump for me to trade up from my fold 4
Ugyvur2ttLrZxq278cZ4AaABAg,"As someone who has been hesitant of foldable devices (mainly due to durability), I appreciate seeing incremental improvements versus any drastic changes. In my mind it shows Samsung is dedicated not just to the concept of a foldable but the continuity of the mechanisms behind it. That being said, I do feel that devices like the Oppo and Pixel Fold hit the mark a bit better in terms of their overall form factor while also incorporating the improvements being seen in Samsung devices, so there&#39;s still a balance Samsung needs to strike in order to stay competitive.<br><br>I&#39;m seriously considering the FlipZ though, I <b>love</b> how small the device is when closed. As you said, the front-facing screen treats widgets in a way similar to how WearOS does on the Galaxy Watch line-up (which I just got the 5 and love it so far - no real need for the 6) and I appreciate the consistency between the two user experiences. Thanks for another fabulous video!"

UgxJgcA04IDQwrXCIzV4AaABAg,When they review apple new phones they look so happy üòÇ with a lot of energy! But when is Samsung feels boring üò¢üòÖ
UgzW5NTzuKkgDPZdBKR4AaABAg,BUT did they bring back dex for the flip? I was so heart broken signing my contract for my flip 4 to find out no dex... and other weird QoL disparity with usb 2.0
Ugx3M9P_upJ0uHvgsyh4AaABAg,they need a shashibo form factor that combines the Fold and Flip and folds in both directions.
Ugzx9gzV_czJB15No7B4AaABAg,Gotta love Samsung chasing the ‚ÄúMore is More‚Äù design philosophy. How many screens does a phone need? Not a fan.
UgxZZbD_bfcbeAv_8zZ4AaABAg,Folds flat at least
UgxJgjcKFxQl_hiavXt4AaABAg,"Gone are the days of massive innovation all at once. We will be spoon fed so they can slowly suck us dry. No reason the spen shouldn&#39;t be housed internally by now, smh."

Ugz3MrBWz0SiAgi9_V94AaABAg,"I&#39;m not a Samsung fan at all, I&#39;m not a fan of foldables at all, but I think that Samsung&#39;s foldables look like the most polished and developed of all. Good job Samsung!"

Ugz1s7mcwNmrchVw8QN4AaABAg,My wife didnt like z fold 3 and asked if i wanted it. I said sure but have come to totally love it. Great for my job.
UgzfADaI0SmeZW-DoNh4AaABAg,I think it&#39;s fine to do incremental updates. I find it fascinating that Apple can keep the same form factor for years on in and everyone thinks that it&#39;s the best thing since sliced bread. When Samsung decides to make a change in its form factor it will come right on time and should have all the bugs worked out of it! <br>Great work Samung keep it up!
Ugzj0AycQSGjMMVGtSZ4AaABAg,Make the Fold passport size and put the Spen in the extra space- and more battery!
Ugydj9EWoHoyjINq1Qp4AaABAg,I cannot believe they fumbled the ball on flip 5 when not making the frontscreen fully accessable for the normal phone like Motorola did with theirs. Huge let down for my part.
Ugw6HcSzeyoohnUMGp14AaABAg,Fold 3 and 4 both can reach 1200nits in auto mode
Ugxar5nz6ZkyvowlhZx4AaABAg,Its hilarious how my next recommended video is mrwhosetheboss saying this is the biggest upgrade ever
UgyQqIFnXGXg0OvU_SV4AaABAg,"I am sorry that Samsung does not change that much like, for example, APPLE?"
UgyPgpv6DjSz8uBQIMB4AaABAg,Settled? I guess you could say they... Folded.
UgwM7ieEy_hTzmapS1h4AaABAg,Camera and tall size is what&#39;s keeping me off

Ugx-G9nTEezf9BLusDR4AaABAg,"Great, a phone that have screens on all sides for you to break."
UgzZTXQ6xi9lJplxA994AaABAg,"I don&#39;t see any better folding phone than Samsung&#39;s Fold, the S9 Ultra is the best tablet on the market (for what I think a tablet is used for in reality), and the next product should be a device that blends both, a tri-folding phone (what I dreamed that the &quot;Z&quot; would refer to - you know, &quot;Z&quot; has 3 lines/displays üòä), that when it opens is relatively a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=16m10s"">16:10</a> tablet"
UgytLS78FZDlDqWJ92l4AaABAg,"Samsung should keep their flagship phones aside and do whatever they want to do, I am okay with that because a person needs the reliability and a phone that can do everything perfectly is the most important aspect and that&#39;s why people tends to prefer Apple over anything and you can&#39;t name any other brand doing that and that is the reason why Apple is the way to go."
UgwKuld1GC2ZAwfNzRx4AaABAg,"Fold 5 fan edition, wider outer screen, passport sized"
UgyVzMr_TKAZKE0wcpt4AaABAg,"Samsung in general makes great electronics. I had an all-in-one desktop PC that was a great value in 2014 that I had until 2022. But Samsung‚Äôs ethics have much to be desired. My new PC had by far the worst case of bloatware I‚Äôve ever seen, for it came with a program designed to nag you in buying 40 different products, from antivirus to operating system enhancements. After many pop ups and a horrible system slowdown I decided to do a clean install of the OS, for uninstalling the pernicious adware always fails, reinstalling automatically on the next boot. However, Samsung was very nefarious and clever, by hiding a hidden file in a Windows directory that could not be erased by a simple format of the hard disk. I had to resize the HD to defeat Samsung‚Äôs bloatware. So my question is this: Why should I now trust this scumming company for something vital as a phone? Can their promotion software be obliterated?"
UgwyNuowPjyevAyZ5vB4AaABAg,I currently own a Z-Flip 4... I&#39;m seriously considering buying the new Razr+  just because it has closer to stock Android OS... I&#39;m don&#39;t like the bloat of Samsung OS.
UgzFLcE2xAzZ_R55jgh4AaABAg,"Jeez...Samsung needs to fix that stupid super skinny aspect ratio for the outer screen on the Fold. I returned my Fold 4 because I COULDN&#39;T STAND that tall, skinny ass screen. And it was thick af. They need to make it more like the Google folding phone. Until then, I&#39;m keeping my S23 Ultra."

Got the fold 4, pro watch and pro ear buds last year for like 900 bucks after trade in so not a bad deal. So I guess we will se if I do the same thing I always do lol"
UgxNTJVTBqQ2jqpL6-p4AaABAg,I really like the pixel fold aesthetic and I hope to see Samsung do something similar even if it is going to market it with a different name .
UgzxQxEH8Yd8Db34v3h4AaABAg,"The form factor of the Z flips are great for me.  If it was wider, like an s23 ultra I wouldn&#39;t buy it.  That extra width is uncomfortable to hold."
UgxMzi-l60n7HNtuSUh4AaABAg,"The main question for foldables, for a lot of people, is: &quot;Can you see the bend now?&quot;<br><br>The two issues most people seem to have with foldables is durability of the screen (since it can still scratch pretty easily) and the bend in the middle being pretty visible."
Ugw8dYFJnitloCJ8GgB4AaABAg,This just validated my choice in buying the pixel fold.<br>Also I disagree with the whole new phone for features. They phased out the note and just added the s pen to to the S 22/23 Ultra series.

UgzPpUxJMal9L08MLd54AaABAg,I got a feeling that the phone tech industry will only do major upgrades and different looks on their mobile devices after a certain period e.g.10 years. but in the meantime will give customers little updates. just like the car industries are doing.
UgyKfSSST5wMmX0h8m14AaABAg,"I dont get it, are you expecting a redesign every year? <br><br>Why not review the iPhone the same way"

UgwuEmfqZQ6vAHCAhF94AaABAg,Samsung doesnt have a lot of competitors in the foldable space in the United States at least.  They can squeak by with incremental improvements unfortunately.
UgyQdvnlB-1EluIvggJ4AaABAg,"I had the flip 3 for half a year and my biggest dislike was that it was sooo tall. Taller than iPhone pro max, and even s21 ultra. I wanted it to be 1 cm shorter and 1 cm wider. I haven‚Äôt watched the razr vids recently because the first ones were bad. I wonder if they‚Äôre the company filling that need for a wider and shorter flip."

I literally trade in my ultras every year and get the folds for like 300 to 400 bucks which includes the new galaxy watches or buds

Ive been using an s10+ since it came out and ive been waiting for a foldable to come out that is good enough to last the 5 years my s10 has but with these marginal upgrades i dont know if they will. My s10 is showing its age now so I&#39;ll have to upgrade but I was really banking on the fold
UgyhtHd0FWhC6ypzibN4AaABAg,I have the Samsung s8 tab ultra and it is spectacular. The user experience is wonderful and I use it every day.
UgzYaPUj_XA6CAApmGF4AaABAg,"I think they might be preserving form factor to make it easier for front-end programmers to develop optimized apps for the foldable, since it is a very niche display config"

UgznJYFOdkiKlJGHImN4AaABAg,As someone that works in retail selling phones I suspect this will be the least selling foldable series they&#39;ve ever had..until they launch a completely covering warranty for those foldable screens the horror stories will always keep people away from these.
UgyolOZNt1rJZAIK6Bd4AaABAg,"What a joke.... What&#39;s even more crazy is that people will actually upgrade the fold 4 just because it has a new number in its name.... Lol, turning more and more into apple every year.. but hey, if you can milk the population for more money, I guess why wouldn&#39;t you ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
UgxFQ05aKbbvN_t030B4AaABAg,"Every company has been in the process of cost cutting over the last year... expect everything to slow down. GPUs have slowed down, phones apparently too, electric car tech will slow down. What we have been experiencing for a decade is not realistic. Streaming services will have less and less new content (which was mostly filler crap)... the amount of money companies have been burning over the last 10 years is INSANE. The waste brought-on by absurd investing on free debt is beyond what you can imagine. Billions if not trillions. That&#39;s over. We&#39;ve been living in lala-land. Companies are squeezing the smaller and smaller &quot;Tech Bros&quot; / upper-middle class segment right now, with the same high prices for new products that are barely above last gen. They know they won&#39;t be able to do that next year. Unless they manage to get major improvements with minimal investment, they will have to release &quot;meh&quot; products, and lower prices. Honestly, I hope so. I&#39;m holding on to my 12 year old computer, my crappy entry-level outdated phone, and my 2011 sub-compact car... buying anything new right now, or even 2-3 years old, makes no sense financially."
UgxQzx1hisYqWWEevpJ4AaABAg,SAMSUNG. The standard settler !
UgzcsDZwaYYwqfc43nV4AaABAg,Just gotta say: a new hinge design is not an incremental design for a foldable.
Ugxa8lYZgkSNG8YwWvJ4AaABAg,"I wish Samsung start to make a cheaper version of these phone now that they settle, would love a flip phone but I don&#39;t need that much power for a phone since I&#39;d save that for tablet/laptop."
UgxuLFtl-UAvpEQpmYl4AaABAg,"preordering and upgrading from the previous version is pretty affordable if you trade in, so I don&#39;t mind paying like 50 to 60 dollars to upgrade to a flip Z 5 with a nicer outside screen. They also give a free upgrade to 512gb if you preorder and a $50 additional preorder discount. Plus you can combine with a student discount and get the phone for like 45 dollars, if you trade in the flip Z 4."
UgwVD115gfrWd3d-7894AaABAg,"I was looking forward to update my phone to the flip z, but what a let down"
Ugx5DCeqFVlkQ0FvVrl4AaABAg,"Little improvements, very apple like."
UgyBDdyhnp_KeZphOhl4AaABAg,"I see the market looking for a portable tablet, Z fold. But Z flip? Nah don‚Äôt waste your money"
UgyLHSN01FRY3IMW2lJ4AaABAg,Curious about the flip&#39;s hinge durability compared to that of the gameboy sp
UgxrUhz3ZK1pgoUd5xN4AaABAg,Can we get a review on that tablet MK?
UgxaZ87j2cUaOt4yerB4AaABAg,"Love my Fold3, but it&#39;s definitely falling apart and I have a huge bulge in the  lower part of my hinge when unfolded. Was really hoping they would move past this design."
UgxWJ8Jx6-NmgCrDZrF4AaABAg,Moght buy a z flip after my contact is up in 2 years in happy with my s22 ultra except it&#39;s just to big and heavy I want something more compact
UgzlCwEVdtKtew1javt4AaABAg,"I think this is a pretty good indication that these things are not selling much at all.    I have never seen one in the wild.    One speck of dust in the hinge can brick the thing.   There are just too many downsides to a folding phone, despite all the desperate hype by the YouTube set for them."
Ugz3ba3qe6T4j-JTWAl4AaABAg,"The real deal is that Samsung doesn&#39;t have real competition in the West, so why innovate? Right now, the Honor Magic V2 has the best hardware, but it&#39;s not backed by a major player, so Samsung has nothing to fear. We&#39;ll probably see the same thing again next year, with a new chip and incremental design upgrade. You know, the Apple way."
Ugz1AmX0Yjijc6cU4gp4AaABAg,i like ur t-shirt
Ugw1P0fAY2bh-6DwOYR4AaABAg,I&#39;ll buy a google pixel fold
Ugx9HLsorqq0j7YZB8F4AaABAg,I&#39;m hoping that this is gonna lead into the next generation being cheaper.
UgzM_E8rzGJTnFjW6Mt4AaABAg,I feel like a folding phone would be perfect for me as I usually use it while sitting down where normal people would use a tablet. But these &quot;improvements&quot; are so bad I&#39;ll stick to my S22 Ultra for one more year and hope that they use better screen tech without having the ugly visible hinge on the inside next time.
UgzpQa7ZCsVrj4YhDCt4AaABAg,"Samsung wanna say<br><br>This is our identity, we don&#39;t need major design changes."
UgyMC3ZvcDBCqBWeCdp4AaABAg,I&#39;m so disappointed about the camera situation. I was considering the flip. If only the cameras we upgraded.<br><br>The tablet looks amazing though. Please review itüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ
Ugz3-uw4KTlkSOZh9ql4AaABAg,When Samsung drops the exact same device no one has a problem with it lol
Ugx4tf412nxjcY2egcB4AaABAg,So basiclaly fold 5 a refresh <br>.. because it&#39;s  the same phoneü§îwtf
UgyZsN8mD3JyypezHh54AaABAg,Setteled? Huh? This Apple Fan doesn&#39;t see that Apple has settled. I believe that only Samsung still brings innovations and something new.
UgwwhciJf0qGC-4C7J54AaABAg,"They are probably working on other things! But the larger screen is a plus, but that new processor is a huge deal!! It&#39;s a big leap forward!"
UgzcC9LdoRN91cYap0N4AaABAg,the battery is an L imo

UgzkUmU3GXKhPP3FDyl4AaABAg,Seems it will be waiting for the pixel fold 2
UgzIklmLfRR4PL_7Wct4AaABAg,Fold 4.5
UgzS5DdOqV5J8gsRK_94AaABAg,I still want Samsung to come out with a budget oriented folding phone. It wouldn&#39;t need a flexible OLED screen and could just be separate LCDs and a hinge.
Ugz2nuEXiwyphtZDBqd4AaABAg,already pre ordered the flip 5
UgwIptOIAwciXOFnuFp4AaABAg,I&#39;m gonna wait until they figure out how to remove that CREASE. Yuck!
UgyY2Kmvmxr306IoEnl4AaABAg,Yeah bye samsung im getting honor magic v2 instead
UgzIScLvSzMjV6uQEdd4AaABAg,"The new Samsung Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5 have been released, featuring notable upgrades. The Z Flip 5 comes with a more powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip and an improved hinge. On the other hand, the Z Fold 5 retains the same design as last year&#39;s model and offers two foldable options. Additionally, the Z Flip 4 boasts a larger outside screen, measuring 3.4 inches with a Flex window, allowing for easier readability and glanceable information without having to open the phone.<br><br>In terms of hardware, both the Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5 feature a new cover screen, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the cover screen and back, and a new hinge. However, the phones maintain the same cameras, battery, charging speed, crease, speakers, and inside screen as the previous generation, with a base storage upgrade from 128GB to 256GB.<br><br>Regarding the Z Fold 5, improvements include a brighter inside display reaching up to 1,750 nits compared to last year&#39;s 1,000 nits. The S Pen has also been redesigned, now 40% thinner and can be carried in a flat case. Software enhancements consist of optimized apps for different screen positions as well as an improved task bar supporting up to four apps. However, certain aspects such as the triple camera system, under-display selfie camera, battery size, charging speeds, and water-resistance rating remain unchanged.<br><br>Samsung&#39;s approach to their foldable phones reflects their comfort with the current form factors in the market, leading to minor updates rather than major changes. However, some critics argue that Samsung lags behind competitors like OPPO and Pixel Fold, lacking innovation in design and camera technology. The Z Fold 5 is considered similar to last year&#39;s model and may not offer the same level of innovation as its counterparts.<br><br>Critics have also noted that the outside cover screen of the Fold3 is not comfortable to use compared to the Pixel Fold, and the tall and awkward shape of the display impacts typing and content viewing. Samsung seems focused on sticking to existing form factors instead of exploring new designs, leading to a lack of improvements in the under-display selfie camera, back camera quality, battery capacity, and absence of an S Pen slot.<br><br>In addition to the new folding phones, Samsung has announced other hardware improvements such as watches with bigger screens and thinner bezels. They have also introduced the new S9 series of tablets featuring the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip, with the S9 Ultra tablet standing out due to its 14-1/2-inch, 120-hertz display. The price of the folding phone remains at $1,800."
UgwDMaZLxFUhzmfGh4x4AaABAg,"The thing is, I don&#39;t think foldable and flip phones are at the state of settling down right now. They are not suitable for the mass number of population the way they are"
UgxHKgfxYGacC9hOkOd4AaABAg,Already? seriously?
Ugxf1j0yK1ejoNXtt514AaABAg,Why does someone who hates Samsung choose to review Samsungs new phones?
UgwelpLoO7ciWpuSqRt4AaABAg,no dust proof huh ?

UgxPQxGj7jqX1oIEz2N4AaABAg,"I used to enjoy Samsung phones, but they&#39;ve just become the most boring company now. Also how do they still have the worst crease??"
UgxsW8_L2AsW-sQcpPV4AaABAg,Sigh... looks like I&#39;m sticking with my Vivo X Fold. Z Fold short aspect means they can&#39;t fit the 4-cam setup like the S22/23.
UgzGgCpCnlvn7En9O2l4AaABAg,"Hope they made an update and make the front display entirely useful, like actually using apps or doing stuff because the snap 8 Gen 2 should be used more üòÇ"
UgymLVrHiP0ZkeeqKa14AaABAg,"Delivering completeness is undervalued in this video. Getting pocketable, durable, water proof, higher brightness display with stiff and flexible viewing angles is the innovation here. The style and substance are apt"

UgwOJI7ZAjM8d9bhlUZ4AaABAg,"Soon we will have foldable foldable phones, because the screen on the outside is getting too big..."
UgyrHCpF_rtXGp8Ezpt4AaABAg,Hey Marques why are you not subscribed to your Auto Focus channel buddy?
UgyVuaNEF2Ag0vuY4sV4AaABAg,ü§£ I am reminded why I have unsubscribed from your channel. You became such a die-hard Apple fan that you bash anything else that&#39;s different. I would love to hear you use the same descriptive vocabulary when talking about the iPhone 12 to 13 and 13 to 14 and so on. Doesn&#39;t Apple settle all the time and isn&#39;t it their thing just to do the same thing over and over again with significantly less upgrades and just using old tech? Why not glaringly point that out for Apple not just Samsung? I&#39;m just saying transparency and consistency is a nice and have across all platforms. I personally use both Samsung and Apple for my work and prefer Samsung after doing this for 20 years. However at the end of the day I don&#39;t see Apple coming out with anything new and innovated
UgzJst4zcGQGI3QQzPx4AaABAg,I&#39;m glad I bought the Google Fold

UgziVOmX4u8eK1u_AEV4AaABAg,"when i saw the flip 5 i was laughing because i am sure the motorola guys would be saying hey, our  3.6 inches, 1056 x 1066 pixels, 413 ppi, on the razr 40 ultra is even larger then the external screen of the flip 5"
UgxER16tJGlGnU21_Xd4AaABAg,In Australia the price for Z fold 5 256GB are $2599 $100 extra.
UgyjqdH0j3jto2z53G14AaABAg,Hate to admit it but Samsung is turning into Apple no more innovation no more thinking outside the box they doing the same thing apple is doing which is basically selling you the same phone for a higher price every with very minimalistic upgrades
UgxjeeT8ilErHb6W9od4AaABAg,"This is the iPhone way, if it works good, don‚Äôt Change it‚Ä¶"
UgwBNMorls-RSRq23TZ4AaABAg,So basically I have note10+ and I&#39;ve been waiting for a decent fold version to upgrade to! And I see this‚Ä¶ and I get confused! Should I go for the fold5 or go for other available options? üòÖ
UgzAYIpmXgpTer2sj-54AaABAg,Fewer moving parts..not less
UgzQxG1ie4YRkPL8b9t4AaABAg,Who would&#39;ve thought that folding phones would be among this years most boring smartphone-releases
UgyqfNy-IeCX_YMGb9d4AaABAg,"I am personally really interested in folding phones, especially the folding phones, which give you the option of a much bigger screen, but I honestly wouldn&#39;t buy one of them just yet. Not just because of the price, but because I feel very insecure with the inner screen which is basically plastic. I would love to see brands looking for ways to improve the durability of the inner screen without sacrificing the folding capability."

UgxCCyxfcdo71vSy5Z54AaABAg,I think I have got to a point where I don&#39;t give a fuck what they do with a phone. Just make it usable.

I hate the look of the Pixel fold I refuse to buy it.<br><br>Why is Samsung not fixing the out screen and making it either wider or less narrow? Who are they listening to? Certainly not the customers
UgwxwccIeY_qh9u3u7x4AaABAg,What turnedme off from Samsung.. #1 Bloatware. #2 when i got a Pixel my samsung watch wouldn&#39;t work with it.
UgzmLfIBKE0-UVvaWox4AaABAg,Unfortunately it feels like this year is a bit of a nothing burger in terms of innovation.  I think I am holding out on a foldable until the stylus is packed inside the unit.
UgwoKAwsPeHCdvnDd354AaABAg,So they did a (s) version move. gotcha. Flip/ Fold 4s.
UgyCz1YtlErUunVuNBR4AaABAg,"Just like VR Headsets, Flip phones are suffering from innovation due to the fact Apple is not yet in the game to give users a different and improve product."
Ugxs5qPAGgiQ6uaz0qJ4AaABAg,Galaxy note edge is where this all curving display started. From curving display to foldable ones. So we can say that galaxy note lay the first brick on road to foldables.
Ugxiy_hH10G75E1BY4Z4AaABAg,"I miss the word play at the end, so:<br><br>When Samsung settles, there&#39;s surely some space for someone to supercede."
UgyS_3LdtvALvPVlRWF4AaABAg,Don&#39;t worry about being the same... let&#39;s see the next iPhone surely a 100% the same and the same what you saying right now.!
Ugx6GPviuL-A7K2Y2SB4AaABAg,samsung&#39;s first disaster phone in flip category by price .. better to go for motorola ultra by price
Ugxf6sNJlndfpOD1Cyx4AaABAg,It&#39;s time samsung moves to a different aspect ratio on the Fold series. I haven&#39;t heard a single good word about their tall narrow outer display so I don&#39;t know why they keep insisting on it üôÑ

UgxIoihOMsfuYx4z45x4AaABAg,its called boring recycling the same thing because nobody is buying the previous gen
UgxshhLYooJMno32U6Z4AaABAg,For the love of God i want a z flip so bad but i absolutely refuse to switch until they lessen thay crease and eliminate the dust under the screen issue. I cant handle it until then
UgxhRVrIaqosjPELoNx4AaABAg,Not sold on the form factor. Folding phones feels like a step backwards for technology. I‚Äôll stick with what I‚Äôve currently got.
UgzHw1lpzY9Rxq5-ezB4AaABAg,Will never understand the fold phones like we went from flip phones to smart phones then merging them both then asking for like 300-600 above a regular new smartphone that are 10x thicker with less durability and a very noticeable ugly crease through the middle of the screen
UgzFadNLh6SQih5PSHt4AaABAg,Boring phone. Keeping my fold 3.  There is no mprovement at all. Not even a 100x zoom lens for that price. No charging speed improvement. Still no sd card slot. No way.
Ugx8ff5U6zolb7npxXp4AaABAg,"Samsung doesn&#39;t want another galaxy s/note situation. Those two phones became way too similar to the point where Samsung was forced to merge the two, hence the ultra. Until competition increases in western markets, Samsung isn&#39;t going to make a fold with an included stylus, large cover display and flagship cameras. You want those things, then buy the Galaxy S Ultra which is exactly what Samsung wants. 2 separate market shares not cannibalizing the other."
Ugzfhxnpbrx-uI7QAlB4AaABAg,Almost a year using my zflip 4 and while I do love the upgrades they added I wish they at least bumped up the battery. It would be cool if the flip had at least a 4000 mah battery. Also the camera still being 12 MP is sad
UgwlP-R171wS-z36prZ4AaABAg,They absolutely settled and Samsung needed a 5 flip plus for those of us with money.  It has dex though right?  How is the crease?
UgzSueVEXOYDV5or_2x4AaABAg,Full video on the tablets this year?
Ugz_U_dRBF-idtVdrXp4AaABAg,"Hey yo Marques, what‚Äôs the reception on those things like üòú"

Ugw2-fUvfe2sOgbbcoJ4AaABAg,I don&#39;t mind how similar the phone is to the last gen when there&#39;s still an improvement (you know they still could make  it worse)... I just swtiched to s23Ultra after using iphone13 for over a year and it feels so much better.
Ugww6-7taNOONeyn-tV4AaABAg,"Thank you, now I will buy and &quot;use&quot; it to show my phone and stand out so i feel included."
UgyGy8pFiMQ8Gy4KBOl4AaABAg,Worked like charm. Thanks.
UgxHEhGHenXyWcIWCpB4AaABAg,I was going to switch to the flip 5 but now I&#39;m not sure. The outside screen seems less functional than my 2020 razr. I think the flip is disappointing and the gold is just over priced.
UgzaGVcPge9FVlgObA14AaABAg,Remember when Apple got blasted by critics for releasing the ‚Äúsame phone‚Äù every year??? ü§îü§îü§î
UgywTEl3EGvgl62mHDd4AaABAg,"2007: Let‚Äôs make flip phones as tiny as possible <br><br>2011: Hmm these new smartphones have screens that are too tiny, let‚Äôs make them as big as possible <br><br>2023: Let‚Äôs make flip phones with a tiny display on the outside so you don‚Äôt have to use the big screen inside that much."
UgyBqMrSZgnWMjONlcV4AaABAg,You&#39;re analysis on Samsung &quot;settling&quot; is totally wrong. They&#39;re not making any profit on foldables so they&#39;re keeping the same form factor to cut down on manufacturing and re-tooling costs.
UgzldoZQ-QUFkpxrlOx4AaABAg,I guess Linus is going to skip the Fold 5 also just like he skipped Fold 4.
Ugw7X6YgeubnlkYTZI54AaABAg,The thing that is keeping me from switching to a folding phone is the cameras. I have toddlers and camera is very important to me. Until they get the flagship cameras I will be stick with either the S series or the Pixel.
UgwinPDLu9YJRZmtHAN4AaABAg,Samsung has spent so much money on these that they need to start making money off of them. Hopefully now they can start bringing prices down too.

Ugw92B3FVHUWuKhRoH14AaABAg,The most important innovation a folding phone can make at this point is price reduction.
UgyKeRy47glWs6W0eKN4AaABAg,"I was planning to upgrade from the z fold 3 to this but I don&#39;t think I will anymore. They still haven&#39;t fixed my major gripes that I have with my fold 3 (battery, cameras, aspect ratio of small screen, and some minor stuff too). Maybe I&#39;ll upgrade to the S24 ultra next year"
UgyS14WFNs0Jpg0SNDh4AaABAg,I had the mega with an OtterBox on it. Was comical talking on the phone with it up to my ear.

UgzWrrcSO460solueQB4AaABAg,"Am i the only one who thinks motorola has done way better job in terms of design and invention in flip phone than samsung? <br>And, am I wrong to think that apple is not even close to giving foldables??"
UgzvMnKAB-7c-qZsvnR4AaABAg,"Samsung always does this, they give you a new product, then a year later they give you the same product where they fixed all the bugs and sometimes hardware.  For example I got an s22 ultra that phone is garbage, I upgraded to the s23 ultra night and day difference. Longer battery life, better cameras, and improved build quality. Which just goes to show, never get the first generation of any new product."
Ugw6OyPrLH7vuvZaM-p4AaABAg,Samsung have stopped trying
Ugy6AKPnRKpF3Gxn3c54AaABAg,Samsung foldables are literally the most boring phones ever and 1799 for the same phone as the older one? Samsung is so dumb istg
UgxI62xLb_Q2lDHGr3x4AaABAg,"I pre-ordered Fold 5 and watch. Visually, the Pixel Fold is appealing. Functionality, it&#39;s not in the same league as Samsung. There is A LOT to be said for Samsung ecosystem, and the device versatility. Samsung Themes for example keeps my phone fresh and interesting. There&#39;s a cornucopia of ecosystem advantages, but I&#39;ll let you cover them, if you choose to accept this mission."
Ugx4SfPhK63-I95SyYB4AaABAg,The Z Flip is the definition of &quot;overengineered&quot;to me. What benefit does it have that it flips? Normal phones fit in every pocket just fine. And the outside screen? For taking selfies with better quality? Why not just put in a better selfie cam in the front and use the existing display?<br>It just provides expensive solutions for problems that don&#39;t even exist in my opinion.
UgxXu3s5LGzxI_uU_4x4AaABAg,Ow the z fold 4s
UgxUSOHBUV7BeVn6Ti54AaABAg,"Still, nothing they make beats apple. Funny"

Ugw9J9io-k8TEUVuECN4AaABAg,"The narrow format on the fold doesn&#39;t bother me that much. Obviously, if you get that phone you get it to use the big screen, so that frontscreen (for me) is just when I need to do something quick, and usually one-handed and then suddenly the narrow form factor is a plus. But I agree - Samsung would probably (and in my eyes should) just keep that form factor, and if they want to introduce something else, make it another phone. - Galaxy Bold (yeah, I said it :) )"

Ugybmkd0YqPp0lxaSfB4AaABAg,"from unsubscribe to do not recommend channel. biased towards apple, so cannot trust the guy. when apple has 6 years in a row same changes as here, it&#39;s new, it&#39;s hip, it&#39;s cool. here samsung does the same - it&#39;s the same phone, disappointment."
UgwXygpi7oyYAwGTyPx4AaABAg,"I&#39;ve got the fold 3, I bought it exactly when it came out and I&#39;m very happy with it, should I buy the fold 5 or it&#39;s basically the same phone?"
UgxNzq_iQECh6h8e4bB4AaABAg,These are one of the few videos where I appreciate having an 18:9 phone with an OLED display.
UgwIXOIYouzCq7vMgtR4AaABAg,I&#39;ll wait for the z fold 6
Ugy89LOYC8tsipRcONp4AaABAg,Watching on my Zfold3 and tbh I&#39;m disappointed at the lack of innovation. Feels like we already hit the wall and it&#39;s only been a couple years wtf.
UgzXSWtWkWGBq9k3VZ54AaABAg,"that tablet is so cool, its like holding a laptop"
UgxHMODpVZsvaiV5mft4AaABAg,"Outside screen aspect ratio, bigger battery, better camera, spending storage. The only things I was looking for in an upgrade and got none of them."
UgymErawX82hRkeCVZN4AaABAg,Improving the hinge and putting a larger display on the front of the phone is pretty significant imo
UgxghLiUEiJSc5wSoC54AaABAg,Loved the phone (2) though xD
UgxXMN5eQzmxIFqKh8l4AaABAg,The bigger phone is too thick and the bezels on both are too wide imo. Needs to be a lot cleaner and sleeker for me
UgzIw_6da-3uGdmWapd4AaABAg,"Samsung Fold is years ahead of &quot;maturing time&quot; from the rest of the competition. Especially with OneUI and Dex it is really the only complete 3 in 1 device (phone/tablet/sort of mobile pc).<br><br>Seeing Pixel Fold with the wider front screen, looks awesome, but when unfolded, the default landscape orientation I believe is wrong for most applications. Adds an extra step to switch to portrait. (and the bezels...brrrrrr)<br><br>Pixel Fold is kind of an early stage phone, with some durability issues and lots of software features missing. (Surface Duo memories coming back)<br><br>Having a Fold 3, I don&#39;t see a serious reason though to upgrade to Fold 4 or 5 and spend again another 1700+ USD."
UgzN-UwTxMpW-bojWLR4AaABAg,I&#39;m still using my z fold 3. Absolutely love it still.
UgwHgucSO_rjIH_bGz94AaABAg,Highly thinking about getting this one. This would be my first foldable phone EVER.
UgyIaLa6uRomIsh0eax4AaABAg,Im very disappointed in Samsung re-releasing the Fold/Fip 4. Maybe we should call it the &quot;4.2&quot;.
UgzXveNFTi7Ud_X2bLB4AaABAg,"Did you show Flip for a Fold and Fold for a Flip at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m07s"">5:07</a> üòÇ"
Ugzrmv9ks27u9dM1XqZ4AaABAg,I respect one of the manufacturers aiming for reliability and standards vs just changing everything every year. Perhaps Samsung is learning from Apple? :P
UgzI-BjXwmTVDbSL8aB4AaABAg,So Apple is not settling only Samsung for bringing a refined hardware and excellent software experience mmm
UgwxYfd22qAi2IGoNqV4AaABAg,"I prefer a cut out then the under display camera, the idea of a under display camera is cool don‚Äôt get me wrong but the technology is not there yet and I prefer having a cut out for much better pictures and videos then needing that one tiny little spot not showing the camera."

Ugzhdb4wNl84rhbff3t4AaABAg,"Xiaomi fold 2 for me it&#39;s different class, and looking forward to fold 3  had Sam fold 2, 3, 4 but tired of size when closed and open,"
UgwdSYtoe3PSqlF9iid4AaABAg,I&#39;ve said similar things before. But even people who can afford an $1800 phone.. Do you really want something that expensive laying in your pocket? Maybe I&#39;m just a grumpy man who doesn&#39;t trust people....
UgwovKuc7-UKKyKwevh4AaABAg,"I&#39;ve been using the Fold 3 since release, and I actually like the cover screen too, I actually don&#39;t won&#39;t it to be much wider, about 5/6 mm would be good but nothing more"
UgwkQQx7fHw1bVZYZPJ4AaABAg,Another big upgrade is the Zflip5 has dex support! I think!? It wasn&#39;t specifically announced but was supposedly confirmed earlier this year
UgytRQ85Bu8bYpzYBeN4AaABAg,Good
UgwjBBh5ddCpLEKRXkx4AaABAg,So i get to keep the new razr+? Sicc
Ugym0mhlHxvlgciyP-94AaABAg,"I&#39;m so happy I didn&#39;t wait and got a S 23 Ultra back in March. So disappointing to see Samsung&#39;s lack of ambition and ignoring the craves of people buying and interested on the Z fold (wider screen, top specs all over, s pen inside the phone).<br><br>Until Apple releases their folding iPhone, the Z fold will just be a subpar phone compared to the S Utra line. Honestly, the better folding phones will keep on coming from Chinese brands until then ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

Ugyfj1jMYnz8sPzhs6B4AaABAg,"Trade-in deals so crazy, it makes the upgrade worth it for me! Just preordered the flip 5, trading in my flip 4. Add in the $50 instant credit samsung is offering...subtotal $49.99 ü§Ø"
UgxOUfi0qdf5DDqLnVN4AaABAg,At this point why would you use a tiny outside screen before flipping when you can buy a normal better phone and get the whole functionality on the outside without flipping
UgxtQ_SrcH1kqOo8exV4AaABAg,Huawei Mate x3 is the best foldable
UgyoRt-Cp7E2DD0Pgst4AaABAg,im just happy they went with a gloss back as opposed to the frosted. At least this one wont feel like its constantly slipping out of my hand.
UgwxoX-svijTMJ6DAmN4AaABAg,Glad they&#39;re not giving me a reason to replace my Flip 4
UgxA0LgTATGz0Gngl7t4AaABAg,"It&#39;s like you always say &quot;If it&#39;s not broken, don&#39;t fix it!&quot;"
Ugz3kVe_gzlr0Tyb_xB4AaABAg,The aspect ratio of the outer display is still bad. I had the fold 4 last year and sold it after 2 weeks. Im not getting another fold until they make the outer display looks and feels normal.
UgyyTAl-6BOaNTTWNkd4AaABAg,The fact that the S Pen is still not in the fold is annoying
UgxrcbQ6KZZ_9hxw-hZ4AaABAg,Sooooo should we wait for a fold 5 or get a fold 4?
UgyKXSSJvuS3CRN57sZ4AaABAg,I just wanted the screen aspect ratio of the fold 5 to be similar to that of the vivoüò™
UgyV0ldaX6-VFKfunO94AaABAg,Tab S9 review pleaseeeee (if it feels worth it)
UgzhN61gO__1BllDf7t4AaABAg,"Prior to the release i was interested and looking forward to something new, but now... nah."
Ugzvnv3Zo8y0YTbsve94AaABAg,it will be a pass for me this year. cant stand this whole micro updating of things these days just to sell a yearly phone. consumer madness these days
Ugw6WBGwK6EXuSRYmyB4AaABAg,"This feels like Apple launching a new iPhone. Same things with just minor improvements here and there. I still own a Z Fold 3 and i find the outer display near useless. I use it in just specific conditions but rather than that it&#39;s non existent to me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m glad it&#39;s there when i need it. However, i just barely need it."
Ugw765ytRJ_nT0LkJ0Z4AaABAg,"Hey Marques! Do you think the price range of these phones would get lower over time? Cause 5 years, 5 generations and still expensive for normal people!"
UgzOAWpTfQtjGAYzq2B4AaABAg,I still have my edge.
UgxJlUG9KTjVhDMFtEB4AaABAg,wow. just wow. apple fan boy to the max. apple compared to apples. same. wake up MB. time for another trial injection i reckon. discuss.......
UgyV8VyfsXUUfX9OKRB4AaABAg,"I remember the S3 and its slogan: &quot;designed for humans&quot; and we were like: Yeah sure, humans with giant hands."
Ugw7Ftwqs-2so4W33yN4AaABAg,"I think Samsung havent settled, I think they dont want to come up with new designs every year and water down the impact of a new design. I think they will keep the design for 2 generations, then drop something so drastically different which will create more buzz and media hype, and make more people want to upgrade, as it would be something totally different or a new experience, leading to higher sales. Thats my analysis of the whole Samsung situation now."
Ugy8xnBhMVKSWX2ZhSx4AaABAg,"I&#39;m so disappointed. I&#39;m still on the Fold 2 and it is really time to upgrade but<br>the 3 was basically the same as the 2<br>the 4 was the same as the 3 and<br>the 5 is the same as the 4<br><br>Basically, there is no major upgrades for 4 years üò¢<br>I can&#39;t even tell the 4 phones apart without really looking close at them.<br><br>Samsung has really become the new Apple where they have such an unthreaoned position, so they dont need to change anything other then the name and one minor feature.<br><br>Then you look at how far the competition has come. But sadly, those are not sold here.<br><br>Hopefully, the pixel fold will force Samsung to do a proper upgrade next year.<br>Where they will fix the aspect ratio, get the pen inside the phone, and so on.<br>So I will skip the 5, even my 2 has a big crack a long the middle of the inside screen."
Ugxnui78H1qsOh4ET3p4AaABAg,I&#39;m just laughing at all the leaks about how the Galaxy Fold 5 screen would have no crease and be perfectly flat thanks to the teardrop hinge.
UgxoDHHLx_y7rWuBAGp4AaABAg,i&#39;ll never get the excitement of flip phones
UgzTBo4mlDzkgm4iQI54AaABAg,They won‚Äôt do much until Apple decides to join the fold. Until them they aren‚Äôt concern with other eom
Ugx2lO7n3tlsinG0lc14AaABAg,Reminds me of the OnePlus motto
UgzRywX_gxQZeHrsFi54AaABAg,I knew the Twitter X logo reminded of someone else&#39;s logo
UgxbOBFsQ4Sgue9zWEd4AaABAg,"Same battery, same cameras, same front screen, same form factor, no pen... It&#39;s the same phone lol. Kinda insulting."
Ugz7qIG4Ru5CenceRkd4AaABAg,The perfect Fold would be a S23 Ultra with a foldable display
Ugy_vroLwlccR_g8lgx4AaABAg,They need a proper competition to reinvent their Folds and Flips. They are sticking to what&#39;s safe since they probably think that they are untouchable for now. I wonder when will Apple join the Fold/Flip bandwagon? ü§î
Ugx4d-WUh65297YDLAp4AaABAg,Still rocking the flip 3
Ugw-j0dOWh2zwPV9HER4AaABAg,"I&#39;m still on my Z-Fold 2: Amazing Phone still, never ever had 1 issue!<br>I don&#39;t even use my computer anymore due to my Z-Fold 2, haven&#39;t for over 2 years.<br><br>I&#39;m waiting on that Tri-Fold Z-Fold to release!"
UgwuMeO5xb5liCzC7Ad4AaABAg,Due to so many of the screens cracking. This is more or less a one year mobile phone
UgwYV1cd0GUhQnP6hyB4AaABAg,Awesome. No need to watch any other video about these phones &#39;cause practically nothing&#39;s new.
UgxoHL8oZZ52iKNK9PB4AaABAg,"No camera upgrades, again. is a no no for me"
UgzbPUYAbVKVT1ewe4J4AaABAg,My fold 4 is great don&#39;t think imma change unless they upgrade camera
UgwWp8thgBfwuW8PQ5Z4AaABAg,"Dude never considered that only because he doesn&#39;t like a formfactor, that doesn&#39;t mean the device has no audience."
UgzJzoafn2sdp2xl4R94AaABAg,I&#39;m disappointed to learn that the cameras haven&#39;t updated since the 4...which wasn&#39;t updated since the 3....so...2/3 year old cameras in a brand new flagship phone?
Ugw3YjZ5Daxwl1OYRDh4AaABAg,Say the same thing when the iPhone 15 comes out
UgxoxFIFheiXC9YhUrZ4AaABAg,Had the Fold 3 for 6 months and I am not buying one again until they fix the inner screen. Within 6 months it was unresponsive to the stylus. I sold it back to Samsung for an S23 Ultra. Folding phones are a novelty until they fix their screen.
UgxsLirI_9nAt20qTuZ4AaABAg,"The Flip phones are really starting to become tempting... I have zero interest in the book-like foldables, but the &quot;clamshell&quot; flips are just so enticing... I might have to get one next year, they just seem like the next logical step."
UgzoTxrJGfaYCZIOlVN4AaABAg,"Z Flip: The cameras absolutely sucked last year, and so did the battery. It‚Äôs a bummer they didn‚Äôt touch on those. Still a useless for anybody that takes photos or batteries seriously."
UgzFQa0PCBQ7a5Emd3l4AaABAg,you need to check out the Huawei Mate x3. you will be impressed
Ugw2bqq7DbuHIlP9jKh4AaABAg,the day apple releases a folding iPhone (if they ever do) it will either one sell like absolute crazy and break records or two if will flop so hard apple will never release something like it again!
UgxGmFTljDwmNBdgKYN4AaABAg,Nah... Disappointed.
UgzFBKVAo2ThFuw3R_l4AaABAg,"man , your captions at the start was like reading harry potter and the order of the pheonix"
UgzXI1DIH61doTR4K014AaABAg,In other words‚Ä¶<br><br>The Fold 5 is a massive disappointment with basically no upgrades or improvements (looking at you cover screen).<br><br>The Flip 5 at least had some design improvements I guess.
UgzyARQo87OIusoV_8V4AaABAg,Apple users will have to wait for 10 years until Apple launches a foldable iPhone.
UgxX4n9VtUqVTF1nyLJ4AaABAg,Flip 5 or Razr+?
UgwwSuch1eNhpa_o68V4AaABAg,"Alright, so apple doesn&#39;t change the iPhone for years. But omg the fold 5 is way too similar to the fold 4. Do go on. BTW, this is coming from an apple user. It seems like android users are afraid of having a phone remotely the same as the one they are currently using. Haha. Also, before you say anything about that, I am currently using an s23 u daily."
UgxVIxCRrOcipAsdyl54AaABAg,"It means that you do not need to update your phone every year; but for new buyers or people who were planning to buy these phones, it&#39;s still a good option especially with an increased base storage."
UgxK4QkrjTFURMWBETx4AaABAg,And then we have Apple watching the foldable market and cooking something up secretly.
UgyQEKC7RVqEjEHLw7l4AaABAg,I‚Äôll say it again. A phone that turns into a tablet that is as expensive as a phone AND a tablet
UgzJtre_16YMg7KyIa14AaABAg,We couldn&#39;t have proper batteries in phones for a decade because &quot;Too thick&quot; and here we are because the stupid screens fold. üòÇüëé<br><br>Oh thank god Instagram has been optimized. I was really worried.
UgxIdCgi5ZWHi-yP-hl4AaABAg,ARE YOU BORN-AGAIN ?!
UgzFesXdw7_gnCOpBEZ4AaABAg,"Honestly as a Samsung fan and user for years and someone who&#39;s used z fold 4 am not upgrading to this, I got the s23 ultra and Honestly it&#39;s super awesome and I&#39;ll still to it"
UgxrZ3S4_ck4wjMMj0Z4AaABAg,"I was waiting on this phone and hoping for a bit wided screen. Since we didn&#39;t get it, I may look into the new Pixel Fold. I like that form better."
Ugz4QV-p2m0J8Pqer414AaABAg,I was really hoping for an S Pen that stores in the phone
UgzeP_vp5f3lNkj9X4l4AaABAg,Great video sir! I‚Äôm happy with my Google Pixel fold after transitioning from the Z Fold 4.
UgzZo60E172rkSvVkIN4AaABAg,A &quot;normal&quot; phone + A tablet seems more practical to me than Fold 5.
Ugys0EW95kbuT32bfXh4AaABAg,"I also prefer the much thicker bezels of the Google Pixel Fold....LMAO üòÇ jk man. No. No, I don&#39;t."
UgxuUhrDfaV4N9UJ9IB4AaABAg,"Literally no reason to buy the Fold5 at least the flip has a new bigger outside screen, what does the fold have?? Nothing!"
UgxEM61x-rjQv9-ceKd4AaABAg,Never Settle
UgyqEs-vmEFsdFEx61Z4AaABAg,"Apple releases the same exact flagship as last year with the iPhone 14 but 100$ more expensive than the 13: <br>MKBHD: Yeah, you know solid stuff, great phone.<br>Samsung doesn&#39;t change a crease: <br>MKBHD: This is what happens when Samsung settles fellas"
Ugyl5rAfY0I8gAeBYAZ4AaABAg,"The tall and large phone makes zero sense when it comes to foldables. Isn&#39;t the idea to have something small that becomes large, and not large then even larger?"
UgwpebnzrKpP0JYm4VJ4AaABAg,I&#39;ve got the Flip 3. Any reason to switch to Flip 5?
UgyD_wAPf6OmSHgr5554AaABAg,i can stick with my fold 4 till the 6 comes out
Ugz4me3UnClAaDGoH6F4AaABAg,"In other words, no real upgrades.<br>It&#39;s called stagnation mot Settled Marquis ü§£"
Ugw7H_eq_nTM879ee5h4AaABAg,"The thickness of those two, when opened, seems about that of a regular phone, maybe even thinner..."
Ugzy8mZ_O6ZTwekSlYZ4AaABAg,Fold when open makes sense.  When closed feels dumb.  Reverse for the Pixel.  We need something in between.... and BIGGER outer screen
UgwRb_MrkN9jSZcIeNN4AaABAg,"To be fair, that is what my face would like holding like 40k worth of camera on my shoulder as well. Also, I think the upgrades to this fold/flip series are basically in the same ballpark as the Nothing Phone 2, not so much consumer driven as they are engineering focused. Once the brand is established enough, it would be almost irresponsible to make any drastic changes. If anything, changes to the design at gen 2 or 3 are more logical than gen 5 or 6."
Ugwumgs9DbAfKf81i2N4AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m37s"">5:37</a> I actually owned the Galaxy Mega 6.3<br>What an amazing phone for it time, dayum miss that phone.<br>Remember watching movies on it with friends, those were the days."
Ugx8r0koBKEjeq2T1IZ4AaABAg,"If Samsung doesn&#39;t do something more with the Z fold 6 I&#39;m ditching them for the pixel fold 2 or another competitor. The form factor sucks and the outer screen is unusable. It weighs too much. The battery is painfully inadequate. The software is the best available but it&#39;s like being first in a race nobody else is running. The price is still obscenely high. I was blown away by the 3 because it was the first actually usable folding phone. At this point though, we&#39;re on the fifth iteration and this just isn&#39;t cutting it anymore. I hope someone actually pushes Samsung to do better rather than leaving them ar the top by default, because Samsung is clearly content with doing the absolute bare minimum."
Ugx7PhExTiR8yFOTI4h4AaABAg,the last Z Fold i got was the 3... never getting a ZF series ever again...
UgyqavZS1kLUVNU9h714AaABAg,"I pre-ordered the flip. For 100bucks with trade in of my flip4, I I thought why not. Ill probably end up selling it to get the one plus fold when that&#39;s official."
UgzVqb7wUf0yKvyru_x4AaABAg,"So remember the plastic screens are still there, the phone is not worth it all due to you accidentally fuck you screen if you accidentally put any pressure on it while having nails, naww basically everything you can think of will fuck the screen."
UgxQO9S6icYClv4wRXN4AaABAg,"I think fold is better than flip,but i dont know why people are going for samsung flip just because of something samsung say &quot;pocketability&quot; its like- people started puting phones in pockets -now after flip was made so i would buy samsung fold not flip."
UgyCmWtLSDDrjoGLRP14AaABAg,Why you are not reviewing Huawei mate X series  and pocket series
UgwjHuBJFQ3iqXXiYSN4AaABAg,Cheap Samsung can&#39;t include a charging brick with a $1900 phone.
Ugyp-OqX6sfO1PK_4uZ4AaABAg,So I&#39;ll wait till next year to buy another phone. I&#39;ll just buy the fold 5 case has the same phone crease.
UgyYNJQH3H4KOHdHQcx4AaABAg,How sweet when you have autonomy over the market and you don&#39;t care about innovation üòÑ
UgySK5Lq2algcTgRd8t4AaABAg,The outside screen is almost as big as iphones and other phones were a long time ago.
UgxXMqqnWdCUj80LRud4AaABAg,"Great content as usual. I would have liked to have seen more change / upgrades however I do appreciate the refinements and the new hinge. And I also agree with you that Samsung is not afraid to try new things. But just to throw a little shade at Apple oh, they have been making the same phone for the past several years as well!üòÇ"
UgxWKJnC0AUEVohKLRp4AaABAg,Im so fking disappointed
UgylQBxUZ9s7qANDK9V4AaABAg,"well, I&#39;m ordering the flip5. Good that I&#39;ve missed flip4"
Ugw2jU7QTy-V_wct40h4AaABAg,I&#39;m totally fine with the hinge on the fold 5 being the only change because it was at the top of my list of hopes.
Ugzd_OtgUz_uv0Cui8R4AaABAg,I think next year they would emerge the note  and the fold together... maybe ?
UgyVZqSSlOwh1fvj4KZ4AaABAg,Thank goodness they&#39;ve brought back the bezel on the G Watch. I was going to keep my watch 4 but may upgrade to the watch 5 now
UgxP02MAO0bGOeZmBMp4AaABAg,Samsung get with the program.... People complaining about 1800 pixel..... Well I would rather pay premium price for a new device than less for a Samsung that&#39;s been the same for 3 years
Ugy2q2WUVoxXS3zX27N4AaABAg,I know S comes from Samsung but S as a prefix sounds super weird. I don&#39;t want an ass-pen.
UgyWie1jTeM82Enb4ah4AaABAg,"The front screen is a game changer for selfies and discrete recording. I think if anyone tried a ZFlip4/5 for a month this would be the thing they would remember about it. And would miss.<br><br>Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the front screen makes it on to all other types of phone. Imagine attending a concert and being able to see the artist instead of a wall of phones. Yep, this feature allows this.<br><br>I wish they&#39;d have focused on the crease vs the hinge. The hinge is ok as is but I think a big people for most people is the crease. For me it&#39;s not a big deal but obviously i&#39;d prefer it if it weren&#39;t there.<br><br>A flip phone with no crease would be amazing."
UgxM-YVJ0Zm-LsY8_0N4AaABAg,"Wanted the flip 5, but after hearing the specs are samey. Settled on an S23."
UgwCQsuKunYlScHf6jx4AaABAg,if it int broke....
UgysfiafvH-GgO9I2nV4AaABAg,btw never settle
UgzIcx95-tn3uGUDRR94AaABAg,"I‚Äôve just been using an iPad Air as a ‚Äúphone‚Äù for a few months. It was just my tablet and I gradually used my phone less and less.<br><br>I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd buy a foldable until they have a more reasonable price, even though I can afford it."
UgyUpGouGDeIyt6dS4d4AaABAg,So no big improvements since the fold 3 nice. They need to sort out the screen and screen projector
UgyiilipOopiZ04z2Ll4AaABAg,"I have the Fold 4, looks like there is ZERO reason to upgrade."
UgwyW78gxWWMNboLGhB4AaABAg,"until the fold can store s pen without use of cases, i&#39;ll settle with my s23 ultra."

UgzyzOlK44QMuBmtMfZ4AaABAg,Can I get your Tee?üòá
Ugxr9XLpmHrPuIpnVLd4AaABAg,"Bye Bye apple , sorry no innovation"
UgwTGsG6QVgt2ZJp6Ox4AaABAg,Will you review the s9 ultra ?
Ugz8fm3EpcNtiBRKGgp4AaABAg,They copied Motorola on that Flip with no gap. No innovation.
UgysyZho0-r3LNBrK0J4AaABAg,Hey MKBHD. I just noticed you accidenyly said flip for fold and fold for flip at 5.05
UgydKpmlRJhyC57QdC14AaABAg,What I really want with the foldable phone trend is going for passport shape with a pen hidden inside it
Ugzf9pctWABfH7_WmqR4AaABAg,"Remindes me of the days when flip phones from back in the day had screens on the outside.<br>Samsung blue eye flip, anyone remembers that one?<br>And the other one remindes me of the Nokia 9500."
UgwmlmqsJad0u-N_xOh4AaABAg,"I would have liked the Fold to have been wider honestly, I mean if you want a big phone you&#39;re going to have the matching pocket size, this big phone trying to be small makes no sense to me. <br><br>Based on this I will probably be waiting again with replacing my phone, hopes settled for the 24 Ultra then."
UgzIxeMskBUDGYVhvoN4AaABAg,I really want a Z phone. Great video! ü§≥üèæüî•üî•
UgyQMq6Zi5RY4-Z_2k54AaABAg,"As a Z Flip 3 user, I love the look of the Z Flip 5!"
UgxOOGtecu8tZUAr5OB4AaABAg,you went to ban companies that were making things interesting ....when there&#39;s no competition this is what happens..
Ugx7LjyBANzFoJc5OXl4AaABAg,"Always the same with mkbhd, iPhone settled since the iPhone 11 yet always hailed for their phones. Samsung settled for generation and is being bashed"
UgwH3CEYbPo1qGYKJIJ4AaABAg,So the unpacked could have been an email.
UgzDJk8PSv7IPcvXyOh4AaABAg,Samsung is becoming like Apple
Ugwf-SlDLuL2lhLY-Wl4AaABAg,"A passport fold form-factor with a cutting edge camera, built-in S-pen silo would be a Galaxy Fold 6  ultra."
Ugxd7ncfG9ztgc6rA6V4AaABAg,"Does it have dust resistance? The Zflip is one I&#39;d love to buy, and the accessories collabs they release ARE SO BEAUTIFUL, but the lack of dust resistance and to and extent, the battery life were the things that&#39;s holding me back. I love that the base storage has increased, it makes more sense for that price."
UgxvTtCLsqUQrptwsqh4AaABAg,hi
UgwBMSQVVZIBzU5N7Et4AaABAg,This is the perfect... way to convince us users to find good deals on the Note 3. Flip 5 is probably worth the upgrade. But Note is already a good device at what it does
UgzyvVKYCeKv8-xE1i94AaABAg,"Uh oh I fear Samsung is starting to learn from IPhone..<br>make the same phone every year, they will still buy it .."
UgzuRdlqPNt47ZDDYsp4AaABAg,Five years on and I still don‚Äôt understand why someone would buy a compromised smartphone/tablet combo when you can get a great smartphone and a great tablet for the same price.
UgwMsBDZhbU82h3jka94AaABAg,"Samboring is what Samsung is. There is no need to upgrade from Z4 fold to a z5, save your money."
Ugy1_obZNQS7v72WaMx4AaABAg,Glad i didnt wait for the fold 5 and went ahead and bought the fold 4 when it was on sale for like half the price üéâüòÇ
Ugw-8PxyCGGAglP3rAp4AaABAg,The tech version of shrinkflation. sameflation.
UgxhuhrV4PX_Nl0OFG54AaABAg,@mkbhd I disagree with you flippantly saying Samsung was just trying to see what sticks in the last few years when it comes to bigger phones or curved displays. I&#39;m not a Samsung fanboy but they were very innovative in deciding the flow of smartphone technology along with Apple.
UgwCtjXuE6hCre4YHad4AaABAg,"Samsung settling, i guess they have peaked design wise already. It&#39;s time for the software to catch up ASAP üî•"
UgzLC-dhd_M6l_8mE3h4AaABAg,"Why is no change always a complaint? Yea I just want the phone I buy to be current gen. Don&#39;t care if it&#39;s otherwise the same, I just wouldn&#39;t upgrade if I already had one?"
Ugzcwgoj8bo2JHu2iNF4AaABAg,i dont hear you talking like that when apple drops the same phone each year mate
UgzrNRii2gRGvsBrGoV4AaABAg,IMO the fact that both phones fold completely flush now is huge. They look much better now.
UgyBR-D1-46JwIooRVN4AaABAg,Yo the bezel is back in the galaxy watch?
UgzKoTXgW8RnUYdzp9h4AaABAg,"I find, to request the same price for the previous year model is cheeky, they are doing the same Apple does. Stop Innovating and rake in the cash."
Ugx05UPc93Ne6nP5qOl4AaABAg,"So boring, was hoping for a passport size this year‚Ä¶ would have bought it instantly. Now I need to wait for the pixel fold 2, hope they make some big improvements on screen size there."
UgzjMT7VvB3aUAR3hxd4AaABAg,"Z Fold 4 is the best phone I&#39;ve had in ages. No issues since launch. No upgrade for me this year. I love the narrow form of the cover screen. It&#39;s best of both world small enough to fit everywhere closed, big enough to enjoy content whenever I want open."
UgyxQkTfc78bEwGnUzV4AaABAg,Definetly not upgrading from the z fold 4. I&#39;m just gonna keep this phone
UgyLAhfB7NtgUl2e_F54AaABAg,Anyone wish a manufacturer would bring back phablets? my old mi max3 was a great device and having something of a similar form factor with modern bits would be amazing.
UgxhjHqRUhN1XDc56mp4AaABAg,Samsung is  a failed
UgwBMPE91UAl78DtyN14AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=2m37s"">2:37</a> - I saw what you did there‚Ä¶ had no idea that app existed. Needs to be on iOS."
UgzLInFV1Ct-iOSaFL14AaABAg,Samsung is almost getting as bad as Apple: Small change year after year üò¢
Ugy-J5aYMkMWU35aekV4AaABAg,Pretty boring &#39;upgrades&#39;
UgxANx2_ISqmvT_jyAx4AaABAg,Thank you - This has helped me to make a decision to keep my existing Fold-Z 4 and not upgrade to the 5 üëç
Ugz90iMuffTxnMlrBKB4AaABAg,Been waiting for this video!
Ugy6sFOnVutgYgtW5lt4AaABAg,‚ù§‚ù§
Ugz9FE_M3Kz9u9tF9Cd4AaABAg,Not sure if I&#39;d like the larger outside screen on the flip. I think I&#39;ll wait for the Flip 6 to upgrade.
UgwWYLKrJ7QhUT0UVuF4AaABAg,"I mean some years there are just incremental releases where it is more of an &quot;improvement&quot; then an &quot;upgrade&quot;. Just like S23 series is more of an S22 improvement then an legit upgrade. Has the same shape. Same body. Display slightly improved, added 1 new camera sensor and just overall optimized hardware more to be more efficient along with a new latest SoC and the same SoC for everyone (instead of treating us EU with lesser in house SoC)."
UgxyT8r_AE0WtnzIAhx4AaABAg,Work on subtitles
UgxJGmEhXhPySRQ7QKR4AaABAg,Apple will wait until Samsung do all the prototypes then master then folding phone
UgxwPIzZ0aPJioYochB4AaABAg,I&#39;m annoyed by the inner screen cover and the replacement process and how often they have to be replaced. Too much maintenance for a thousand dollar device.
UgwpYQn2O0Iv6fr93v94AaABAg,From a fold 4 user prospective. <br>FOLD 5 is the biggest let down from a company who is trying to push the fold phone to the mainstream market . I mean if someone has a fold 4 there is no need to upgrade your phone to the fold 5 because the only difference that I can see is just a better hinge and a brighter inner screen . <br>It&#39;s such a let down that there is no camera improvements or battery or no software features to utilise the fold in a power user kinda wayy . This time I feel samsung focused more on there flip phone than there fold as the flip phone has a significant upgrade . But anyways let&#39;s see how well this phone performs
UgwQCAzmv0cIcwGDnVF4AaABAg,Wow. Samsung is f-ing boring.
UgxsDx3bXYWNJOSZs8J4AaABAg,Motorola outer screen is better looking in my opinion
UgzWCLcN1Wq9ZMr06F14AaABAg,"I hope they bring the 3/4 recent apps change to the Fold 4, because it was always dumb that you could only pick 2.<br><br>I have my phone unfolded 99% of the time so I hope they continue with this form factor or at least make it an option. Portrait unfolded is best for reading and web browsing and more natural for using two mobile phone-sized apps side by side. The Pixel Fold form factor isn&#39;t for everyone."
Ugw6qo5HWx81U1Gw9Xp4AaABAg,This is what it looks like when apple settles üëÄ
UgxmB081EFxB3yp8xsZ4AaABAg,the only thing I want them to change about the fold is the tall screen if only they make it wider it would be great.
UgwQaMJSYVMFLiP749Z4AaABAg,Samsung is looking comically like Apple right now with the same design from last year&#39;s model except for that zero gap.
Ugyf06N_SuWpwkHrRid4AaABAg,I still can just not do a soft screen phone. Gimme a S24 Ultra with a flat screen and LG G8 style second screen case.
Ugx38ZsrHFRq9mUiRhZ4AaABAg,"Not a fan never have been never will be üòÇ maybe just maybe if i had to choose id go the flip for its comapctible size, i dont need a tablet when on the go. And if Samsung are not going to improve the design change it up after gen gen 4, what is the actual point, hinge aside, makes no sense and doesnt draw me to them any more than when they first came out."
UgwhvClNhRt9EzYIY5B4AaABAg,Who is using this these phones again smh
UgzR-XdtE-kYs9Xw_z54AaABAg,I don‚Äôt understand why statements are like this like apple been using same design since iPhone 12
UgzqJzY8dzKfVFITUSl4AaABAg,Accidently just order the fold 5
UgxxLP4YH9lxlpFhr_N4AaABAg,Love your stuff man! Always so informative and it&#39;s fun to watch. I ended up getting my gf and one of my best friends into your content
Ugwbk3_8SHUHezByYtN4AaABAg,I would totally buy a foldable iPhone
UgzA10hL30K0PwHWLHl4AaABAg,Gutted.. Literally no reason to upgrade from my fold 4....was hoping it would be wider!!
UgzZ5OWc0k36NMrePjF4AaABAg,Razr+ releases bigger screen - &quot;Huge leap forward! New Generation!&quot;<br>Samsung releases bigger screen - &quot;They settled&quot;
UgxwT5c4-kblqVxSMOV4AaABAg,"my worries for any device like this is how durable is the screen really, especially since its getting folded, and the Hinges themselves."
UgzWtU0e3O0UumU-2bZ4AaABAg,You should be thanked more often. Thank you.
UgzebBHbVf_UDrci35t4AaABAg,It seems like every other BIG REVIEWER who published their reviews exactly on cue are gushing about the huge updates! I&#39;m with you on this MKB. These updates are minimal.
UgyB7Sfnth2FCA4fWGJ4AaABAg,So we still have the same issue that after 6 month the protection foil will come off at the crease... That&#39;s the most annoying part of my Z Flip 3. I already changed it once and yet again it&#39;s getting off and after a while will get damaged. The screen is still fine but I have to change it again in some weeks.
Ugy3okRZR86t9c7MAyR4AaABAg,The most interesting part was when you talked about the Tab S9 Ultra
UgwSEgP5BJAsK8_5thR4AaABAg,Seems like the flip is better deal this yearü§î
Ugw6qKYfdKAvO_uVpAB4AaABAg,"I find the Attempts to make larger out displays in the others&#39; competetors foldable kinda stupid... Because the concentration on the fold is to use the inner larger screen. And when the outer screen is more like the normal size of a non-foldable phone, then users will stick to this side of a foldable and rarely open it to get use of the larger screen."
Ugy4QbKTxZpwZi9Db9V4AaABAg,This should have been the year that they reduced the price to $1499
UgykXtOb3oUmoXj9JW54AaABAg,still think it is a dumb idea... a soft touch screen plus its thinner structure limit the camera space.
UgyO6O0fVU7tIEs3MPt4AaABAg,"But the fold in the middle is still visible, and the price is still too expensive."
UgyK1D8tEPI_uyvGGzF4AaABAg,Thank you for giving us nothing samsung üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
UgyWSt9PQDQf_yWpNe94AaABAg,please review s9 ulta
UgzCxd3jtLPRhC-znG94AaABAg,ah they should have changed the outer screen on the fold
UgxUqXtKAjOy43rQoJN4AaABAg,Something that I wish Samsung would do with the Flip that wouldn&#39;t be that much to ask for and would actually get me to buy one would be USB3.0 on the port and hardwire Dex compatibility. It&#39;s ludicrous that this is the fifth revision of this phone and this hasn&#39;t happened
Ugz4OR2I88P6AT-Xg-N4AaABAg,"I like the form factor, but hate the hinge gap, I&#39;ve been waiting till they fixed that before I get one, I would like to see the stylus built in with the new hinge so I can buy that. <br>Then they can change it!   Hahaha"
UgwXC7Ek8dV_A2QsO214AaABAg,cool tech but i would really just stick to the regular phones
Ugy5C4-w7fAyLvfFrVt4AaABAg,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m07s"">5:07</a> should have been folds, flips and others to match the visualization."
UgyndwDEwXd_Ex3AMbd4AaABAg,Basically not worth the upgrade for owners of the Flip4 and Fold4
UgwqjH9Pqm3AK5R0_dN4AaABAg,Fold 3=Fold 4=Fold5<br>Therefore<br>Fold 3=Fold 5
UgyVhIr09hT5x1TDvPF4AaABAg,You forgot to mention that on the Flip 5 you can now use apps on the outer screen.
UgyhM1ohZxobKK46nz54AaABAg,"They are giving new and still immature products like foldables yearly upgrades on par with established and ultra mature products. Which is to say, not good."
UgyTDnxM_XLpBHSx4894AaABAg,does the flip 5 have usb 3?
Ugzl8iARnSKEhesichd4AaABAg,after keeping everything same for so many year atleast they should have reduced the price... 1500$ may be?
UgwZerVyaL6KUH488pJ4AaABAg,How abaut temperature ? Fold 3 and Fold 4 are too hot too use !!
UgyyN4bs1ns26IzBfv54AaABAg,"The thing is that the taller aspect ratio on the fold is good for holding it. I love being able to reliably, dependably hold my fold in one hand while using it, because I never wear a case. Also, I just like opening it up if I feel cramped. That‚Äôs the point, right? Idk those are just my thoughts after using the fold 3 for the last few years."
UgyKDLggGcmEG7Q381R4AaABAg,"Man I used to be so excited for new releases of phones and other stuff, especially from Samsung. I hope Samsung will try out new stuff like they used to. Also a triple fold would be sweet and it will also fix the aspect ratio issues on the front and the inner screen"
UgzRVneuQ0-0sUwEDSV4AaABAg,"That&#39;s disappointing, especially with what we see that was release in China by Honor and Huawei... it&#39;s sad ee are stuck with the same phone over and over again."
UgxJ7qpiay0il1ZRWiR4AaABAg,Them not changing much makes me wanna buy the razr
UgxttgkwmQ8ZAwZok554AaABAg,"You guys been getting small incremental changes from Apple for so long, yet you guys buy it up with no complaints‚Ä¶Samsung settles a lil bit and it‚Äôs all a sudden big deal üòÖ"
UgwnDWjQPpFrrECBaUl4AaABAg,"As  a Fold 2 owner I was thinking about updating but now I&#39;m not sure. 3 years passed and they barely changed anything. There are some nice features, but then there&#39;s the 25W charging that was considered slow even 3 years ago. Compare this to the latest Honor foldable, it&#39;s just seems a different league HW wise. Not sure what Samsung is doing."
Ugzbcld_XsIakyC5IsF4AaABAg,25fps is better than 24 or 30! xD
UgyEFFrJrMLV1BLBXLJ4AaABAg,Anyone else notice how the presentation was absolutely embarrassing? It was like a comedian who just bombs. The only genuine &quot;laugh&quot; they got was for the rotating bezel on the classic watch. The show was just brutal. I&#39;m not really talking about the products themselves but the delivery of the information.
UgyTDSS_ldmHWlJzK8h4AaABAg,Did Flip 5 get Dex? can anyone asnwer please
UgxO-V_d6RSQpsuB2A14AaABAg,They could have improved the cameras at least smh
Ugz4Pyy-rCedaTswztZ4AaABAg,No upgrades to the camera?? I will pass on the flip 5 and wait for the 6 to upgrade from my Flip 3
UgynND-3vdP77p0xMoV4AaABAg,"It‚Äòs funny how Marques says ‚ÄûThis is the state of foldable in general‚Äú while Apple doesn‚Äòt get the same treatment regarding the ‚Äûjust phone‚Äú factor. <br><br>The Mega phone being mentioned reminded me of how the S3 and S4 back then were so much bigger than the iPhone and that was the reason I wanted a Samsung. Well, now I have an iPhone 14 Plus, haha!"
Ugw3NRH4LBJIHb84Fq94AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m06s"">5:06</a> the flips? the fold? üòÖ"
UgzdJmeNDmpfnbf4Qul4AaABAg,"im not following, how there&#39;s a lot of review but samsung hasn&#39;t even dropped a trailler for it"
Ugy1jcCFYYHkmuKNdpt4AaABAg,I think if they make the z fold to be slightly more wide and slightly less taller so it can make a 16:9 when its fully opened with the bigger screen it would be perfect shape for it. This taller screen doesn&#39;t really fit with the content we consume on our phones also we naturally see things in more of landscape way as we have eye laid out horizontally not vertically.
UgyigRFaz5o-sqWZUXN4AaABAg,"honestly, the folding phone as just of no interest to me. i hate the glastic inside screen. they are stupid expensive. the only foldable I&#39;ve liked was the original MS Duo. I loved that it was two real screens, nothing on the outside and a 360 degree hinge. the dimensions felt great. not too narrow, not too wide or too tall. imo that is the best design for a foldable phone. unfortunately it got worse with the Duo 2 and now rumors are they are dropping the design and going into a foldable screen as well. I&#39;m honestly moving away from flagship and going into the cheaper phones. get near flagship for hundreds of dollars cheaper."
Ugxr8dkr9rIb7_lbOCp4AaABAg,"Happy for the phone to have minimal mprovements if you lower the price but as someone who has a fold 3 I am not willing to pay these prices to upgrade to this. I will personally be moving back to a flat phone with a better camera,  battery life and a cheaper price"
UgzLu5wsLX99KUnuuil4AaABAg,Genuinely excited for the future of fold phones
UgzIT7OHQaDJVAUqBL54AaABAg,So they took a page out of Apple&#39;s playbook and change the fewest features between iterations.  Although Apple would never reduce the price of the phone memory.
UgzZsCeyxgOdZlm-8yl4AaABAg,I wanted the Samsung Mega üòÇ I did have the Note (4) Edge. Sold it. Got the S6 Edge+
UgwBPygt0gNSQ410BiV4AaABAg,"Woah üòÆ<br>Also, 946th comment"
UgxDElPraDvB2_4tQHZ4AaABAg,"Samsung does OnePlus. Or, we&#39;ve settled."
UgyNDkNzAhLyqsOIbnV4AaABAg,Huawei foldable was bold
UgwqrJi5Hx73q-nyq9x4AaABAg,I just realized that one of these when folded would already suit me completely
UgwsT68I2nbNnUCpW9p4AaABAg,iPhone is OVER!
UgyQOc7hsx510zWZOVx4AaABAg,It all really depends on what the future generations do. <br>They need to recoup some of the money from being safe before they can really shake it up again with an entire new design.
Ugx2UfhZ7mzUJll5zkB4AaABAg,totally Agee. don&#39;t know why Samsung keeps being stuck with narrow and long foam factor.
UgxL_1o2Tsl8b_JjTAN4AaABAg,I never understand why every youtube content creator complains about the front screen being too small for watching content on... Why would you watch content on that display when the whole point of the phone is to use the big internal screen! it really baffles me! personally i love using the front display as its easy for one handed use for checking basic stuff. Literally what it was designed for...
Ugy3QSxvby4fjocRAu94AaABAg,So the Z Fold3 should be a great deal right now.üëçüèª
UgwzqTBRTBzYtXCMa7B4AaABAg,"$1000+ phone, fuck that"
UgzmuHnA_FtKgYdfysh4AaABAg,Galaxy mega was a huge seller and specs weren‚Äôt that great‚Ä¶ I worked at AT&amp;T when those were released
UgwxoaKNMmtnfaziNQN4AaABAg,Curious. Was 5G added to the Tab 9 Ultra this time???
UgypJd7aGoyzf-HiULR4AaABAg,I would have liked if the fold had been a little wider
UgzThx35ILo1WHmlLux4AaABAg,"I use the Fold4 and I absolutely love how narrow the phone is! It makes it unbelievably more &quot;grippable&quot; or just easier to hold in one hand, especially compared to how girthy üòè iPhones are. I understand the utility of a more traditional aspect ratio but for the sake of ergonomics, they made the right decision. Also, I love how everyone complains about typing on the cover screen, but I do it all day everyday and have zero issues as I&#39;m mostly swipe typing anyway (which is also much easier to do compared to a traditional phone)."
UgxquVh3nVmYhVPoKc14AaABAg,who actually buys these ?
Ugy5H9TfdqRdSGmkl0R4AaABAg,"Samsung settling, i guess they have peaked design wise already. It&#39;s time for the software to catch up ASAP üî•"
UgweQzxrk8eG4wXgHGl4AaABAg,"Anyway with Samsung introduce flip &amp; fold years ago, phone world become interesting again."
UgyVrvHJoPxlFCLDVll4AaABAg,"Booooo, the z flip 4 looked cuter"
UgwP1EmO0CwqrgxweuR4AaABAg,"I&#39;m personally set on wanting a foldable, and I love my Samsung phones. However, I really dislike &quot;candybar&quot; ratio on the outside of the Z Fold phones. And the Z Flip feels to similar to an &quot;entry-level&quot; flagship phone from the previous year, it doesn&#39;t feel worth it"
UgwzCcl2SZt3l2uyAiJ4AaABAg,"We really need Honor, Xiaomi and Oppo to release their phones in America. Oh yeah, Huawei tried that and got banned..."
UgwvzGowF2gxkXF4_cx4AaABAg,yeah Apple year over year changes so many thing I can&#39;t even recognize their phones anymore üôÑ
Ugy8yLzykxSgU00bar54AaABAg,Settled? Sure.<br><br>But I&#39;m getting it haha
Ugym6YBbCc0SQfzGLNl4AaABAg,"I remember when my galaxy note 3 was considered a &quot;phablet&quot; with its 5.7 inch screen. If they made that phone today with a modern soc, connectivity and cameras, I&#39;d buy that in a heartbeat."
UgwQM9S9HAnnMHf1bt94AaABAg,Moto Razr+ &gt; Flip5
UgyT8xWppkx4nfh45ix4AaABAg,They need to make the external screen of the fold the same width as the Galaxy s series.
Ugw4cdZQld9sZZ_0XO94AaABAg,Samsung is the new Apple.
UgxV2_uO8xGf3KFDAZd4AaABAg,FOLDING PHONES<br>Still A Gimmick !<br>           üòù

Ugxfk_mUbsQ-uqTEwuJ4AaABAg,Gotta say I much much prefer the Pixel fold design to the fold5 but the flip5 looks great
Ugy_RcLVic5kc7S8Pn14AaABAg,You should have said‚Ä¶.. ‚Äú They ‚Äúfolded‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶ instead of ‚Äúthey settled ‚Äúüòè
UgxxOIXKn3FMuP3bpk14AaABAg,I phone needs to come out swinging with the new iPhone flip. Seriously need a flip but android is not my favorite
Ugx_5uOGs-N9gK68HF54AaABAg,Folding phones? not for me thanks
Ugxe-lGxwnwcHHMEwxB4AaABAg,Upgrading from fold 3 to fold 5. Once you go fold you can never go back :)
UgycHVkiE2rXF7m8b-Z4AaABAg,I just got my fold 3 replaced with warranty good not till the 7
UgwyG2CuVuHZdv5y7UV4AaABAg,I still believe folding phones are gimmick
UgzheXFsHDEa7QiPhad4AaABAg,"Samsung is on his way to be a fail brand in phone world, Samsung is doing his best to fail. I don&#39;t understand what type of company and business structure Samsung have, I think they don&#39;t listen their costumers at all or they don&#39;t hear them at all. In my opinion Samsung is the worse phones company that offers Android flagship devices. Even China&#39;s non sense ghost brands like Oppo, Xiaomi act... Offers way better flagship than Samsung do. Also it seems to be devices offered by Google will take over entire Android market in 5 years."
UgyF5dC2ejTzGci1Re14AaABAg,"Samsung winning the Least amount of things changed award! Fold 4 for ¬£1099 or Fold 5 for ¬£1900? That&#39;s a difficult decision, said nobody ever."
Ugy3bqu2Pno5ZP9fVmd4AaABAg,Honor v2 vs fold 5
UgytErwoRWUWlXx7yzl4AaABAg,So disappointing. I have a s22 ultra and wanted to move for the fold 5. I wanted a camera and battery upgrade.    I will have to wait for the s24 ultra before deciding what am i going to do.
Ugz7EqlVMLwAjqBPhox4AaABAg,MKBHD always straight to the point.
UgxzKHHVWd8JwumO3Bd4AaABAg,"I decided not to get the fold 5 months before release, got the S23 ultra instead. Very happy with it, Samsung has to work hard to make me switch to a foldable. I&#39;m not seeing that happening even next year. Maybe with fold 7 or whatever they&#39;ll call it., if they finally change the tall form factor to something more sensible and put an s-pen inside the device. Hopeful-wishful thinking, I know.."
UgyRpNr6atTQblcZ7jV4AaABAg,I&#39;m passing on the z fold 5 I wanted better cameras and a built in s pen
Ugy4_ulyoR8dryvogKJ4AaABAg,Man I&#39;ve been waiting 3 months for the new fold. So fucking disappointed. I wish I could get honor magic v2 fold in my country.
Ugw6GYuATXvFIp93zWV4AaABAg,You know what this tells me that iPhone 15 will be internal changes only.. no new style or anything like that watch‚Ä¶
Ugx8DdLgMj3OW3s36K14AaABAg,"These phones are horrible. Screen protectors lift after a month or two, and your carrier deems the display &quot;damaged&quot; so you can&#39;t trace it in. Gotta get ahold of Samsung to fight them to fix it. I can&#39;t believe samsung isn&#39;t doing anything to take care of customers with their 3rd and 4th gen foldable devices. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we see a multi million dollar class action."
Ugxi7aHoq4ImqaQKIk94AaABAg,Not good enough to compel me to buy any. I&#39;m a wedded in Samsung guy but none of these jump out at me. Disappointed
UgzZPhZwkxCxRZc_E1l4AaABAg,Some of us are tired of these phones getting ever so larger yearly like the feds balance sheet. Soon we&#39;ll be back to the size of the very 1st mobile phone. We want all this tech in a samsung s9 size package. Give us current gen tech in that size.
UgyVyTDkUDnIPJOSj6x4AaABAg,"They are not settling, they are maximising profits.<br>Making the next generation product too good just means it&#39;s harder to exceed the next year for customers to buy. Instead just make small increments every year to continue selling the product. $$$"
UgzQ6FGi6O5gAF-HBo94AaABAg,Let the china folding phones goes on every market and samsung will not settled. Because theres no a challenger
Ugx94CEPEmc28gf8swx4AaABAg,no
UgyLgcu21OZDpMaLOGF4AaABAg,"Can someone make a foldable with a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=16m10s"">16:10</a> or 16:9 aspect ratio inner screen"
UgyP2qYZsFNO9QqbFOJ4AaABAg,"Quiet disappointed, Samsung could‚Äôve updated the cameras that is biggest downside of foldable‚Äôs."
Ugxc8eL4MQLZ32T2deN4AaABAg,Glad I didn&#39;t wait and got the Razr+ when it came out.
Ugziat5kOP4xxvzyDt94AaABAg,When other brands release minor change on new devices Tech people be like: Not doing any change is good / They are settled / I like it / It‚Äôs for user familiarity <br>When Apple do it they be like: Apple has no more innovation ever since Steve Jobs passed away!!!
Ugz_Xnv73TpmOVKcbxV4AaABAg,The Samsung way? IPhone gives you the same phone year after year only differences is color and size...ü§£
Ugyjf8IhNhJxpWZLJQV4AaABAg,Most boring video ever seen üòÇ
Ugyctl4i6DleutI66yR4AaABAg,much too expensive phone. and not even s-pen integrated. buuuhhhhh
Ugx2c5-UPgMcUKpBflF4AaABAg,There are three main simple things that have kept me from buying a fold series. One is the lack of the upgraded is 22 and s23 Ultra camera specs. Two is the outer display. I would definitely like something wider to type in w content on in case I don&#39;t want to unfold the phone. And 3 is the lack of the included s-pen  within the body of the phone itself. The other used to be the huge gap with the hand and the lack of a IP rating. They have seemed to fix these two things so just a few more to go Samsung and then you may just get my money. Other than that we need a more significant upgrade. I know it&#39;s only a years difference in time between the four and the five. But for the price we need better we need more
Ugz_GMOIT-JV2lXoR6x4AaABAg,Google and oppo have proven this is the exact wrong shape for the S fold
Ugy8MLoR8Vt0IoxwTEl4AaABAg,"I&#39;m confused about the outer screen on the Flip.  At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=1m19s"">1:19</a> in this video you can see it running maps so does this run apps or just widgets?  The map thing for me is the biggest one - not having to flip open the phone whilst navigating round a new city would be great."
UgzB0uPHZh1JUwqrzfF4AaABAg,Samsung is a monumentally bland company
UgySJik38UnJFS8o2BV4AaABAg,"Definitely not a good year for smartphone makers or every semiconductor manufactures, historically low sales at this point. So they just decide to use the minimum development fees to have the safest phones release."
UgywxKEuKjJrm8HUr2Z4AaABAg,"I&#39;ve been rocking an S9 until now and its battery is starting to struggle, so I went to the local webshop to see if they had the Flip5 available for order yet and.. Not only did they have the introductory offer of 512GB for the price of the 256GB (I expected that to be a Samsung webshop only deal), they also had a bundle that added the Buds2 Pro for an additional zero money. They still list the Flip4 256GB for a higher price than all of that. Good luck moving any of that stock.<br><br>Edit: Apparently the Buds2 Pro bundle was a deal for the first 50 orders. For once, a proper pre-order incentive."
UgzM9O3owOPtN5vDrWp4AaABAg,Samsung have best inovation team
UgyDv3x630mwdry6_-V4AaABAg,I wish LG would&#39;ve held out longer. I think the option for the scrollable phone they had would&#39;ve been a good alternative to the folding devices.
Ugy_bYg_06Uk-IY1UBB4AaABAg,Moto flip (razor) is way better than this. Moto allows all apps to run on the outer screen. Also cheaper.
UgxyQUoaOK2lEVwvWu94AaABAg,"Sooo.. they basically just took the same phone made screen bigger for the flip, put a gen 8.2 chip, and sold it for $999 just to compete eith Motorola and a no gap hinge because all the other companies with flips and folds are selling em that way now"
UgwBIMNIoBJ6oidzcX54AaABAg,If they could just make an S ultra with the same camera but a smaller phone I would be pretty happy
UgwmZizf2St3u6g6pdZ4AaABAg,Samsung missed another opportunity to make me upgrade. I WON&quot;T pay $1800 and get a camera that is worse than a less expensive phone. They HAVE to put the same quality of a S23 Ultra if they hope users upgrade. Another big disappointment.
UgxpAmlMUSlg_7O6Rcd4AaABAg,Why do we need an external screen to display what a regular phone can do? Isn&#39;t it redundant?
UgzHqqTrwNoOr5ufv6N4AaABAg,"Android fanboys has been saying Apple doing the same shit every year meanwhile Samsung does the same exact thing <a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>"
UgwJIhJdTq6FDf1KcMp4AaABAg,Waiting for that tablet video!
Ugxz5shoYTjfOIvEkZ94AaABAg,am still rocking my 2yr old z flip 3
Ugyap9c8cm8BDJDhgxJ4AaABAg,SAMSUNG ‚ù§
UgymcI-ewGxai-cWPv94AaABAg,"Lets face it, samsung is so far ahead in this space, theyve no need to change it dramatically and potentially lose customers."
Ugx4F-RO60qB13yF09Z4AaABAg,As it relates to the selfie camera inside the fold it makes sense there was no improvements on as its marketed as a business phone for people in corporate work environments and the flip as younger generation (GEN Z) type of phone seeing as the camera quality and personalization are much more high quality. Basically two different phones for different types of people.
Ugx07ZPAR7Yn6THSQrV4AaABAg,"Samsung already peaked on their flagship devices, like two years ago"
UgzLcJysnaLjnSdwGId4AaABAg,Samsung is literally every single huge company right now. They settle for what&#39;s safe and we depend on small companies to bring us something fun and then the big dogs take the idea and combine it with endless money to make a new version of it.
UgyBMfzoguYNpRU1Pfl4AaABAg,"So now that the top dog of foldables are out, which fold will you recommend among Samsung, Oppo, Huawei etc?<br><br>Personally I love the Huawei Mate X3 but it doesn&#39;t have google.<br><br>Oppo Find N is next best but their very new on the block.<br><br>With the S Pen option, I guess Samsung is the only option, no matter how horrible the cover screen is!"
Ugz6SvD23lwYOoMBjzJ4AaABAg,"They really need to fix that fold aspect ratio.  It&#39;s such an obvious flaw, seems like literally everyone hates it."
UgweFLmckbS37-LD6ul4AaABAg,I just want the camera to match the s22 ultra or better.  Wow samsung your most expensive phone without even close to your best camera. I&#39;m dissatisfied
Ugz815sJTstS4AWZjV14AaABAg,Crease seems to be reduced
UgzSASegrAociqb4jV94AaABAg,"I have to say Samsung really has no innovation and creativity. After a year, they creates an almost same as the one they made one year ago, which really makes us upset and disappointed. What we really want is a brand-new phone, not a same phone, Samsung please!!!"
UgxmKd2ZFhgHQWX1oWJ4AaABAg,FINALLY A DYNAMIC AMOLED TAB üò≠
UgwNgzdqJVWjqYtvyXd4AaABAg,I hope they realise the current ratio of the cover screen is not really practical. I do get that it allows one hand operations to work better but it needs to be or it must be the conventional regular phone ratio that we are all familiar with :(
UgwB_rx2JBAhOmapxht4AaABAg,when Samsung keep the same design every android npcs be real quiet lmao but when apple does it everyone treat it like a sin
UgynXOY9eHJoY5hQ5hB4AaABAg,And still a lower resolution on the big screens of s9 and fold than their on s23 ultra !üòÇ<br><br> It&#39;s 2023 we want 4k resolution !
Ugwhf6Qkm9RjZyDPcvd4AaABAg,"They look good and shit, I mean it&#39;s Samsung.. But Pixel Fold has stolen some of their &#39;wow factor&#39;."
UgxUIqbScCkt-Ghea8N4AaABAg,Hi
Ugzbej2u4T8tmuy-PWN4AaABAg,Watching the unpacked event and I feel like they didn&#39;t really say much about any of their products. Everything feels like an refresh more than anything. I kinda feel like we&#39;re at the point where we don&#39;t need the annual events anymore. There&#39;s just not enough new stuff here.
Ugy0t_fRkJBo8tst-LR4AaABAg,I would have bought the fold 5 if it had a good camera... I&#39;m kinda pissed they fucked it up
UgySpiQNXWS_nIcu5Rt4AaABAg,"The flip 5 is ugly af , shootout to motorola for the kicking ass with the best outer screen"
Ugw5Ta7ukARHVo1-GTh4AaABAg,"Brands love a signature look that they&#39;ve mastered. Technically it&#39;s smart. It just sucks that the signature look is not as appealing as other phones. So I agree if they did a different design it would just be another phone in the line up. The ppl that like it will buy it the ppl that don&#39;t or are bored can get something else ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. H/e they know they have a loyal base that more than likely will still get the phone even if they&#39;re tired of it looking the same, so it must not be that big of an issue"
Ugy0ckUnGxc5H176NoF4AaABAg,"So boring. Most of the Chinese companies are trying to do different things with foldables, but Samsung just doesn&#39;t care. Pass. I&#39;m still not seeing anything here to get me excited."
Ugz8hQuwcsGEQTKXhlp4AaABAg,"Nice, But nope! still KEEPING MY (S22-ULTRA), until Samsung Delivers us the Real Promise of replacing the next fold 6 or 7 with either 108mp or 200mp lens in the phone then ill trade it in for one, yet the majority would rather have the s pen slot built into it, however i&#39;d rather have the better lens &amp; bigger battery than the s pen slot, i hardly use my s pen in my ultra really."
UgyRig3V6cMBPLtalot4AaABAg,The new fold looks great. The only thing holding me back is the price.
Ugy1iUqRVyK1C5IgNkJ4AaABAg,Idc about foldables but im glad they broguth back the classic model for the watch. Not having it for the 5 series was just dumb.
UgwNyS1zm8QtuzY1HzZ4AaABAg,Well it be durable compared to last model where the screen came apart had to replace whole phone because of it twice!!
UgyC5LUQ20HbtXug1cB4AaABAg,no word on one ui...
Ugysb2voMUcy10411fx4AaABAg,Samsung has a thing where every even number phones are innovative and every odd number phones are the refined version of the previous phone. They have been doing this since s6.
UgxZE1Lz0vPpKDsQlql4AaABAg,"As someone who was rocking the fold 3. This does look and feel like a significant improvement. It‚Äôs subtle shades of grey between generations, but it is getting better year on year."
UgxTvDfL2fJUU20j3nN4AaABAg,"If the Fold 6 or 7&#39;s  (if they&#39;re continued) outer screen doesn&#39;t look more like a Xiaomi Fold&#39;s outer screen, I&#39;m never upgrading from the 4. I will opt for a foldable with a better outer screen."
UgzGxUIc1j6FxtKJdKN4AaABAg,The selfie camera isn&#39;t a defect. They just have a built in promist filter
Ugzv9zJH1iszG2eZqSl4AaABAg,Not worth 1800.  Maybe 800.
UgwLaGhjtKuAm28njp54AaABAg,This is crazy they didn&#39;t change anything but still charging 1800$. They need to lower the price at least 600 $ to be the Considerable option against the iPhone lineup
UgyGi773xkzex1mnA9h4AaABAg,It&#39;s a big shame they are keeping the price the same for no major upgrades...
Ugwk5Xv-SrInkV8DlVN4AaABAg,i want Samsung to make a wing like LG did.
UgyjyOHiR6LZmUqEsQV4AaABAg,Maybe they are waiting for apple to release a fold and change the design concept based on apple fold?
UgyI1bIAcviezBmtWNF4AaABAg,Those are 29.9fps not 30.
Ugy039qE2qIE7S_8ZAF4AaABAg,Meh
UgyfsgF8QXFIUmdshEd4AaABAg,I think the screen brightness bump alone makes it worth upgrading. The Fold4 is almost unusable outside in the sun...
UgyJrKbiKcAtJ85L4TZ4AaABAg,The Motorola Razr is actually really impressive considering Samsung‚Äôs Fold is considered flagship‚Ä¶
UgwIlWbH7ocouEc3Wb94AaABAg,it&#39;s ok no need to reinvent the wheel each time make it more durable and better battery life  i don&#39;t want no passport chubby phone the only things that would be cool is the s pen on top screen
Ugw5OqCm739jEk-UnoR4AaABAg,Looks like I&#39;m sticking with the Fold 4 until we see what the 6 has to offer. I am however excited about the Galaxy Watch 6 though.
UgwWat0EFZgqN2ANcA94AaABAg,Phones are becoming one in the same and very boring. Bring back the sidekick lol
UgxQ5Qo-VqQE_zA2iaB4AaABAg,I for one don&#39;t want Samsung to change the form factor of the Fold. Brilliant for one handed use and fits the pockets better.
UgwHkjwMRvyHID2xhld4AaABAg,SAMSUNG UNPACKED ‚ÄúTHE SAME‚Äô
Ugx4DZPcfXD9I47gqYl4AaABAg,"Apple&#39;s been settling for years, so it was inevitable Samsung would follow."
Ugxi6undze-r6KTik2J4AaABAg,NO GALAXY FIT NO S24!  Nobody cares of flips and tablets.
UgwQgQj831nF7iMlfL94AaABAg,"Samsung basically decided they&#39;re done innovating on the flip phones and stopped playing the game, which just makes me excited to see what their next future innovation will be."
UgzU0Un2rwUQvTzaiy14AaABAg,Samsung has definitely cut a corner with the outer screen.
UgwUe3uxOGTopE0yScJ4AaABAg,Untill samsung change the dimensions on the fold to note or ultra  size when folded then the majority won&#39;t be interested! Huawei already achieved this! ‚ù§
Ugyaf_qGp-IFVifhZId4AaABAg,Why Samsung release new phones every year.. Same phones with fresh looks..
UgxcZdMt-9BPsyd6Tpp4AaABAg,"Not a huge fan of MKBHDs take. Samsung has established an identity with their Fold and Flip, and personally, I dont think they needed to change much. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 already did a lot of heavy lifting in the S23 Ultra. Why not with the folding phone line up? I think a slightly wider screen would have been nice. Just add another mm but i guess you can say, Samsung gives you a reason to unfold your phone. Otherwise, whats there to complain about? I will gladly upgrade my 4 to the 5 and not think twice about it. I can tell you, Gapless design, better battery life and nicer screen is all need."
Ugy7sxKySoW5AggNAIV4AaABAg,Cornelius Would Be Proud.üôåüèª
Ugx4HcXAXibLl5fhQyl4AaABAg,"Samsung settling, i guess they have peaked design wise already. It&#39;s time for the software to catch up ASAP üî•"
UgxcFe9T6zbOhLKO5AF4AaABAg,"There is a bigger outside screen for the flip and it can do much more than you showed... Your reviews are getting lazy<br>You don&#39;t give a shit about the flip, you are a fold guy, but personally like others I prefer the Flip..."
UgyjiwVWxKP_GNW4yCN4AaABAg,Welp....guess imma wait for the 6
UgxDW7qDnfOc5ihfwVd4AaABAg,"As someone whos daily driven the fold 4 for about 6 months now, the only big improvements i think they really have left are the under display camera, battery, and s pen storage inside the phone. And the crease i guess but that&#39;s an industry-wide problem. I think its kind of disappointing that theyre offering so little in terms of upgrades but still charging that $1800 price tag though. I think a lot more people would be willing to give foldables a go if they could drop the price by any meaningful amount. And getting new first time foldable customers seems important because i cant see many Fold 4 owners feeling the need to upgrade to the 5. At least from the 3 to the 4 you got a pretty big leap in camera quality."
Ugy1ZQdalZipOSE3oWp4AaABAg,i wish the settled into headphone jacks.
Ugw3ThazgwXeUq9TRx54AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=4m45s"">4:45</a> they have no competition so they don&#39;t need to change much"
UgwYVB28z2PE-SW8AaN4AaABAg,Why every new iphone gen what more gives you?
Ugz3VQQ2j2qwOmJG2AB4AaABAg,"Get a Razor, you&#39;ll love it better"
UgxQPeCt86ooMhziLFt4AaABAg,"Don&#39;t agree! They are perfecting the form factor, all those phone you mentioned are complete dog sh*t. Pixel Fold is a hot fking mess, Oppo trash software etc etc. Samsung is by far the best exp on Android by far. + they have 5000 models of phones to pick and choose. I have a Pixel7Pro and it is complete trash, only usable in the US with trash battery life"
Ugysilkiu9soniVgnRB4AaABAg,"considering the market state, its not a good idea to spice things up by dropping prices or invest too much money  in innovation."
Ugy_BbgwLpOVdUlVH7d4AaABAg,Should check out the Honor Magic V2 which foldable phone as thin as S23 ultra‚Ä¶ and even lighter.. that‚Äôs quite amazing
UgzYthfSdCQ5--mo6fJ4AaABAg,The SPen on Z Fold attach to the phone or need to get a casing to hold it?
UgzITgTk2Z_Uk4zvceh4AaABAg,No more innovation... All the new techs are boring üòí
UgzOM0B6EL54wcx1aR54AaABAg,This is the state of flagship smartphones in general.
UgwPZWzUCTZHrKJGwbR4AaABAg,Pixel fold is better than z fold 5 and moto razr is better than z flip 5...it&#39;s safe to say Samsung has fallen behind the competition.
Ugy5OlYEPWx5QSzDxq54AaABAg,one mistake in the video animation when you say &quot;the flipssss the foldssss and the other&quot;
Ugwpi40aMOphh28j4h54AaABAg,That was fast. just finished watching the Live Unpack LOL!
Ugzb2McZZjJ3CkUJfvp4AaABAg,I don&#39;t get it Apple will sale the same design phone for a few years in a row and it&#39;s always the best iphone apple has ever made. Samsung does it and everyone loses their shit
UgwbtuEEmY8iToc8Drt4AaABAg,Zlip 5 front screen is ugly ngl
UgxazAHyzws4GAnUvaJ4AaABAg,So basically it&#39;s a fold and flip 4s not a 5
UgxU7rljYkMAROj9UV54AaABAg,The z fold 5 will be the last. I don&#39;t see too much of a  difference in the video but I guess when you have it in person you probably can tell . I think it&#39;s time for the rollable phones to come out .

Ugzyr6t47VFCHoBYNmp4AaABAg,"This is why I like iphone, because at least when they keep the same thing for a while, they add a bunch of little extras to make up and the don&#39;t rush to throw out anything until it&#39;s perfected or better than the comp."
UgwOfkynB0QkHuS7p0x4AaABAg,"their foldable software seems the best in the market which allows them to don&#39;t worry about the hardware as much. that being said, the squarer form-factor of their rivals appeals to me more. you&#39;ll still be using the phone closed a lot of the time."
Ugyu2Gu5LG5SH1uruS14AaABAg,"No they are definitely getting lazy and complacent.   Im a massive sammy fan and have been buying 2 sammy devices per year since the Note 2.  In years past  a note and galaxy  S device and now a  fold and S device but not this year.   Not only is the fold 5 the same form factor with tiny changes, here in Canada they upped the price of the 1tb by $230 from last year and arent offering ANY pre order extras. The final nail in the coffin was offering me $425 for my 1tb Fold 4 lol...i paid almost 3k for it a year ago   i laughed so hard lol....they are alienating their most loyal customers and doing an excellent job of it üòÇ"
Ugw6K4IxOkLQEHVIMH14AaABAg,Day 2 Of asking MKBHD to let me Stress Test the phones he reviewsüòÖ
UgxtJmQ3UYcQXZXxQc14AaABAg,I think they should have updated the camera and used the same chip.
UgztV_wmpfOQc4O4IVN4AaABAg,My biggest gripe with the galaxy flip has been battery life.. why would they not put a bigger battery in this gen especially with the new chip and larger front screen? ü§î
UgxBc9g2G2SEXIUgGt14AaABAg,Why bother releasing new phones when theyre all older phones with new chips on them? companies should rather just start replacing customers&#39; phones with newer chips at a price.
Ugy6Z8jNRfndhyfMOEV4AaABAg,Although some people hate on these phones I still find them more exciting than my iPhone.  <br><br>And I personally don‚Äôt even know why I stay with iPhone <br><br>iMessage sorry isn‚Äôt a good point for me to keep an iPhone.
UgwJRP8cLNtGGpbFkYJ4AaABAg,"I‚Äôve been waiting to switch to a fold for ages, yet past two gens have given me no real reason to convert yet. Was really hoping for something bold this model. Roll on Fold 6"

Ugy17sUig1FOAzLprfJ4AaABAg,"like the new hinge, chip upgrade is nice to have i guess but I&#39;ll skip this gen and wait for some serious changes hopefully coming to the next gen"
Ugw_-eryAvGsaTGNQl54AaABAg,"They probably worked on this, and finished since last year or at most, earlier this year, since the development and production lifecycle is pretty long for company as big as Samsung. I honestly do not expect any kind of changes this year since the only real possible competitors to Samsung only started using more conventional-size around this year. Imo, they probably will only start changing the aspect ratio for Fold, next year. Its also as expected since the tagline makes it seem like Flip is the major focus this year. <br><br>Also, since they are now extending the software update longer and longer, they also probably don&#39;t feel need to make any big changes, just like how iphone 10 to 13 is essentially same.... just better internals and/or camera changes. You don&#39;t really need to sell a Fold, to people that bought in during the Fold 3/4, but people that bought in during original Fold will be impressed since this is the best Fold.<br><br>Basically, the upgrades this year are as expected. Imo, I will let Samsung get away with this for this generation, although I will be less forgiving if they still keep the aspect ratio on Fold 6. No reason for them to do it, when Pixel Fold is not following suit."
UgyYh0gX_OWVVZUxuYN4AaABAg,"Disappointing, Samsung..."
Ugwn38DzNKlJTYp10wF4AaABAg,I was looking to upgrade from my fold 4. But I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be doing that I mean the 1750 nits sounds really impressive but honestly I don&#39;t really have a problem with the brightness of the inside of the screen it&#39;s actually the outside display that I have trouble with brightness because that&#39;s the screen you use when you want to protect the inside of your phone<br><br>You know when you&#39;re outside and the sun is out<br><br>You&#39;re not walking around with your phone folded out if you trip it&#39;s over...<br><br>And then there&#39;s the other thing that&#39;s in my head everybody&#39;s talking about how all the screens are breaking of the pixel fold and how they have a completely flat closing display with no gap. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good decision because in the event that you do have any debris in your phone when you close it there&#39;s no gap to protect your screens. I think there should be at least 0.5 mm of a gap because the last thing you want to have happen is your screen to get ruined because you closed your phone and didn&#39;t see particle of dust on it
UgxvzyiZQb0FkuJs0SN4AaABAg,Everyone is WAITING FOR APPLE. Deny it all you want but it&#39;s true.
UgzEb6fk8Fu3EGVkJ0d4AaABAg,"Pretty incredible to read the word &quot;settled&quot; applied to folding phones.<br>Meanwhile, there are trillion dollar companies that can&#39;t even put a new chip in their new flagship phones."
Ugx3W9vbqWl5yCl2fkx4AaABAg,I need this.
UgyK_y141NYGNHi5jxh4AaABAg,"Its not a settling it just a strategy, because sooner or later apple will came to that game with a stolen ideas and implemented &quot;a bit differently&quot;... so why samsung which allready introduced new segment, should feed others, spend even more money on R&amp;D without a real benefits of it.. same was done by google some time ago, google and others kept innovating ( yes, some inivations was better then others, but thats the proce ) and later apple just copied every year by year making even more money of it.   Same we can see on tablet market.... samsung has unbeatable multitasking abilities on tablets, and ipad still trying to copy it on &quot;other way&quot;"
UgxX_a3NuVPOkNeAqFt4AaABAg,I&#39;m bummed out. I was looking to upgrade from fold 3 and honestly I think im just going to keep it until something more impressive comes out. Pretty sad samsung can&#39;t even make their customers want to upgrade after not only 1 but 2 years. Waiting to see what the one plus open brings to the table.
Ugyt9QQCthkI5JNdo7R4AaABAg,Daily driving a Flip4 for almost a year now and I&#39;m sooo excited to trade in to the Flip5!<br>I just hope they offer that in my country üòÑ
Ugyn6X2hb3BjTKRKGOl4AaABAg,"If I had to, I&#39;d choose the Flip.  I already use a tablet so don&#39;t need a convenient large screen, but the convenient store-ability is something I haven&#39;t tried.  Different approach to a small phone."
UgyHuyDPtHUdwA2f5QZ4AaABAg,The outer display screen is simply too weird in the Flip 5. Feels like they have cut a screen and pasted it on the back panel. Motorola&#39;s is more cohesive and compact looking I would say.
Ugwdgq7Zw9kch8h48m94AaABAg,I&#39;m holding off owning a flip until they have a slot for the pen.
UgzyXbfCHyNc-nzJ7TR4AaABAg,LOL! All the those screens on the flips and folds sounds like a nightmare in terms of reliability and expense. It&#39;s complexity for complexity&#39;s sake. My iPhone 13 mini is not going anywhere.
UgyEJNDzBOpLkrJq3px4AaABAg,Can&#39;t we just have those widgets on our always on display for regular phones.?  Flip is a waste.  Fold has some things going for it.
UgyrnYmwmAyPXiEY13t4AaABAg,"What was up with the super childish keynote presentation? The animations, pictures, 100% hipster... come on, it was like it&#39;s meant for kids."
UgyxSabES7uEPlq9mcl4AaABAg,I think they might make a ultra variant of this with a slot for the s pen etc after a few years
UgxjEsJr4FAGNFCcwSp4AaABAg,Some I am paying for last year&#39;s phone with a different name and  a new hat (cover screen) sounds like the iPhone 14 aka iPhone 13
UgwZ_YBju5cyT2w0ewp4AaABAg,"Might have been written below, but if you don&#39;t want an iPhone, your only option might possible be Samsung, either because there aren&#39;t any competitors available (eg oppo don&#39;t exist where I live and the the first pixels were sold under an exclusivity deal last year) or buying another brand will pose a risk update wise (Sony has been an alternative, but their update schedule leave a bit to be wished for). So in the folderable market, samsung can take it easy, because there is nobody challenging them in two major markets (Europe and US)"
UgznPP1O8wMMlNLS97d4AaABAg,"I used the Fold 4 for 4mo and I now use the S22 Ultra. I LOVE the Fold concept but I do not like Samsung&#39;s execution. First, the tall and slender design just isn&#39;t it. When it unfolds it has a very nice aspect ratio but to get that perfect size/shape you have to make the cover display tall and slim. It is not fun to use in the folded configuration. Second: cameras. I love the cameras on the S22 Ultra. On their Fold, at that price, just give it the full camera specs. Give me 10x optical zoom. Battery: because you&#39;re going to burn so much battery with the gigantic inner display, you need to have either A) bigger battery or B) fast charging or both. I found with the Fold4 I was not getting a full day out of the battery and guess what? It was charging soooooo slow when I needed more power. I really hated this. All of these things combined just made it feel like not the best phone to use and like I said I am loving my Ultra phone way more for that reason. Do I miss having the large inner display of the Fold4? Yes. But other than that I don&#39;t really miss it. <br><br>Can they bump the camera specs, improve battery (either with size or charging speed), and change the design so it&#39;s not so tall and slim all while keeping the same price point? That would be very nice. That is a phone I would buy."
UgzCPKJum88WkbkG3u54AaABAg,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m06s"">5:06</a> Minor mistake there. Flip and Fold are interchanged"
UgxOix_0ntP0gGO4NLZ4AaABAg,Another year with my note 10 I guess lol
UgzEeV2YkVVEKxFkI594AaABAg,Maybe its time for phones to come out every 2 years
UgyLbkrAwG91nm1Qdml4AaABAg,This proves that we do not need a new phone every year. Apple and Samsung in particular should switch to releasing new phones every 2 years.
UgxRDapwRe33903ZRlN4AaABAg,its the good time to buy the fold 4
UgwSWMZZRfJMCrvHpH54AaABAg,üî•
Ugxfz-H566JhXW0qTsd4AaABAg,All the centre folds fill with dust and becomes ugly af
UgybHgBwczFL6zkdoJR4AaABAg,Thank you for this review. I&#39;ve been waiting months for leaks!!!<br><br>Edit: I&#39;m not as hyped as I expected I would be.
Ugy4w9v8pjQOhOhgfIN4AaABAg,"Feel like Samsung should take time on working on the galaxy fold products. As they said, they believe folding is going to be the future of smartphones, so if they take time to release them and add more features to it, to make them better, then that will probably be more reasonable. <br>Instead of releasing them on a yearly basis, maybe they should release them on a 2 year basis, that way they can improve on the tech and add more features."
UgzgxMHroHZiYQfDU8J4AaABAg,"Apple settled like 6 years ago. Lol üòÜ but you never say that to Apple, do you?"
Ugzmdt6uPZwaqGf1zfJ4AaABAg,How do you not scratch the outside screen with it folded out like that laying flat on the outside screen?
Ugy87kX28n4Ir1UdUcB4AaABAg,"Nah. Big Flop.<br><br>Basically, zero improvement on the main display of both devices, still has that fugly crease.<br><br>They should just call it the Z Fold 3SS and the Z Flip 3SS.üòÇüòÇ"
UgyyUzoE1RA3Tv2YHad4AaABAg,"Considering my very loyal Samsung Note 8 FINALLY died after what, 6-7 years...I&#39;m incredibly excited to upgrade to the Z Flip 5. Back in 2000, when I was in gradeschool with a Nokia 3210, a friend and I talked about what if future phones were all screens? And even better, what if they could fold?! My dad had a Motorola StarTAC, then upgraded to the Moto Razr V3...that said, this Flip 5/Fold 5 is a dream come true for me, I can hardly wait. &lt;3"
UgyL0dQzWFFakm0cgK94AaABAg,Imagine a Galaxy Fold FE . That&#39;s pixel fold size that would sell like crazy
UgwJ9uZMN66__cvMhjV4AaABAg,"What a bummer, the fold aspect ratio is garbage; wish they would made the front screen wider so we could actually enjoy it."
Ugyc5hILx-p-ZqGHHyl4AaABAg,Dear MKBHD....Was waiting for you to come. Excitement of something new has faded. Moto Z Ultra is more innovative....<br>The best to use in entire series is S23 ULTRA.<br>Thanks and Good Luck.
UgxmvM_975g1ViFc_JV4AaABAg,Can&#39;t wait to see what the new chip set does
UgzpBNiT_K_1QPUM22F4AaABAg,Useless technology innovation at its worst
Ugy-V9ORKPDlaKeJpQ54AaABAg,Seeing this I can&#39;t see why I&#39;m getting Samsung instead of the Motorola razr ü´£ü´£
UgxcQ0xeAzM0f1zfK9d4AaABAg,Can&#39;t help but think that maybe the z fold screen is made to encourage you to open the phone.
UgzJE4zfbRo0KCxtRz94AaABAg,"For me, the Huawei Mate X3 has the best form factor."
Ugz41J9ca50gxZC8Yi94AaABAg,"Lol I had the mega, I loved it"
Ugwe2FzfeBhjQU1isoJ4AaABAg,I wasn&#39;t satisfied with the battery and the cameras of the Flip last gen so this changes nothing to convince me. I  like the idea but I won&#39;t give up my better camera and battery for flipping my phone
UgxcraktrczBug0Kh_R4AaABAg,That&#39;s very disappointing. I have the Fold 3 and was thinking of upgrading.  Might as well get the 4 for cheaper.
UgxNVLu3eOwAPgKVmkp4AaABAg,<b>Me</b><br>1) Packs up my Z fold3 for trade- in<br>2) Watches MKBHD video about new Samsung fold devices<br>3) Swings 3 punches into the air and reluctantly unpacks Z fold 3... üíÄ
UgwwJURwN6l8r65dPeJ4AaABAg,"Honestly, I&#39;d love to see a tablet comparison between Samsung and Apple. Just to see the state of things."
UgzAsgjegEOLwPyHeX14AaABAg,I was excited to buy the new fold but no intersting updates here maybe next year if they add something new
UgxmfZh0f_W7bgpcbKV4AaABAg,SSDD...
Ugzs0BzhqVuMt9dOjY14AaABAg,"The sentiment and tone when speaking about samsung vs apple is quite noticeable  from watching your videos. Look.. I get that apple rules etc etc. But as an android/Samsung user it becomes hard to watch your content on anything outside of the apple ecosystem. Again, I&#39;ll be the first to say Apple can do no wrong.. I don&#39;t think these kinds of reviews deserve less thoughtful appreciation than what apple product reviews get. Peace"
UgxPedi7LHmjoThQf9V4AaABAg,this is now same as Apple :(
UgxLOdXZfEHaiIoG2kl4AaABAg,So I guess I&#39;ll be holding onto my Fold 3 a little longer then...C&#39;mon Samsung!

UgxThgslv0NQ7JRgx5B4AaABAg,"Still rockin my Flip 3, only noticeable wear is that the crease has gotten deeper. Had to replace the screen protector though as the factory one started lifting at the crease, but it was a simple 5 min job."
UgxCxsZiEuGtyonX3Ih4AaABAg,the prices are getting more and more absurd...
UgzF4ZYIoHgB7qLQVNB4AaABAg,Where was this mention of ‚Äúsame and settled‚Äù when apple released the same phone twice with no actual improvement whatsoever?
UgzPTb1D4LcMNfs0-7x4AaABAg,Still a more upgrade compare to iPhones üòÖ

UgzwnWFq0DTLXXAxj2J4AaABAg,You best for presents new Samsung phones I hope soon will be new video for z flip
Ugxym78d-TXdfMMdigB4AaABAg,dont get how mkbhd can have some dominant no. of views over other youtubers
Ugy00SoGR72OSr5P_Ch4AaABAg,I think Motorola will take an opportunity to move on from here.
UgxjeEOUUOnotxONY-t4AaABAg,"The flip makes absolutely no sense, a phone that flips into a typical phone, what‚Äôs the point. The fold at least approaches a tablet experience‚Ä¶"
UgzBO19dd9bq5RzDxAV4AaABAg,Samsung recently unfolded the flip and fold üòÖ
Ugz8hmt33RZRvVPuHLZ4AaABAg,"Better move display to bottom part of flip, there is no camera."
UgyHsoIpdQuI9BjG1c54AaABAg,It&#39;s really a shame it doesn&#39;t have internal spen storage.

Ugx1OLRXggaNuh05spx4AaABAg,"Honestly, it finally folding flat is a huge improvement for me."
UgwObEbk1nlv9Mc322N4AaABAg,I worked in retail phone sales / management for the last 5 years. Samsung have a massive opportunity to introduce a premium spec Galaxy Z Fold - Photography edition (One with the same camera as their flagship) or perhaps that&#39;s my own bias showing...
UgxJxW9AW0OgKGOn_Ld4AaABAg,Wait the zflip outer screen doesn&#39;t let you just...look at normal apps?
UgyxYtOCE5Mm4YWirfl4AaABAg,So why have a flip screen if you already have a screen from the inside. Why don&#39;t they give a Mode where the lock down the normal display to just basic features if people have so many problems staying of there phones
UgxNLNXDR45MS9ldEbp4AaABAg,"If I was Samsung, I&#39;d be really confused right now.. When they used to change, y&#39;all used to talk negatively with some crazy reactions - now they don&#39;t change and y&#39;all are surprised.. What do humans wantü§îü§î"
Ugx8FZ2sA-h37bJaBJZ4AaABAg,"If you were  Samsung, you wouldn&#39;t wanna rist a lot of things of features that would make you raise the price to an already overpriced gadget. If they want this to be used by the masses, they&#39;ve got to to settle for things that make it&#39;s price go lower and affordable."
Ugwhp-3iFRXfKOypR6h4AaABAg,oooooh. disappointing that the battery didn&#39;t get better. I&#39;ll still get it if the trade in deals are good tho lol. last year I traded in my flip 3 and paid only $99 for the 4. fingers crossed for another deal like that! otherwise... might not be worth it
UgwTk501QwZfY_PZvqd4AaABAg,I&#39;m totally bummed this Flip 5 doesn&#39;t have what the Razr plus has which is essentially 2 phones in 1. SO BUMMED!
Ugys4ygxW2jsuiNMTvZ4AaABAg,Honestly liked the smaller screen as in flip 4 than a big one in flip 5 since it does almost the same work. And then Idea of having a back screen doing almost anything is kinda senseless. Motorola did an overkill tbh.
UgwVLq5Te7_YUZIygDN4AaABAg,"Not surprising that they didn&#39;t improve the Fold, it&#39;s already a fantastic phone. But this year seemed like the ideal time to get that crazy 1800 price down to something more consumer friendly. Oh well, just means my Fold 4 purchase was even better.<br><br>As a daily Fold user the only thing to improve that would make any difference, would be cut down the weight and get rid of as much bezel as possible on the outside screen. That&#39;s literally all I want. (Oh and a headphone jack, but we know that won&#39;t happen...üò¢)"
Ugw4ddRMgtmGx1mewXZ4AaABAg,The Z fold 5 feels like 3 generations older than the Honor Magic V2ü§¶
<br>Samsung needs to step up.,2023-07-26T11:49:44Z
UgyuqJzvRfjlXM81v5d4AaABAg,"It still kinda bugs me that just because &lt;10% of the screen area needs to flex, the entire screen needs to be made of a soft material that is proven to crack along the crease and pick up dents during long-term use. If Samsung can find some way to make the entire display out of solid glass except for the creasing sliver of it in a way that doesn&#39;t look or feel janky, that would be awesome"
UgzPrhCnWNH0GTv9BBR4AaABAg,2028 Apple announces the 1st Folding Phone.
Ugy0ySKQmMwtHOoZ18t4AaABAg,Samsung definitely needs a smaller form factor foldable for their lineup.
UgwDDwrnab5buDqvXbV4AaABAg,"I have the fold 2 and was planning to get the fold 5, but it sounds like I would be better off getting a discounted fold 4, would love to try the pixel fold but it isn&#39;t getting released in Australia"

UgziXrDjLC-oW8StxCZ4AaABAg,Cost of living crisis - no-one can afford to buy bleeding edge anymore.
Ugwr40-yyOtP2Ow6N894AaABAg,I dont think front display matters for a fold phone. Its the secondary thing. Its actually a tablet that can be folded for easier use. The main focus for the user should be the bigger display while the smaller one is just for checking notifications or widgets or any other simple task.
UgzJFZ271Gxy2TIwNVt4AaABAg,"As a Fold 4 owner, I think the outside screen is really good for one handed use because of its narrow width. For a Fold 6, I&#39;d make the phone maybe a tiny bit wider but otherwise, I&quot;m happy with the form factor.<br><br>I&#39;ve gone off on most regular phones because they have gotten unwiedly for my hands to use when you just dig it out of your pocket on the go and try to find something quickly with one hand while carrying a bag or something in the other. They are just physically wider than I would like. The Fold 4 by comparison, feels natural in hand despite being very thick. I do think it could be less tall, but then again it&#39;s a compromise to allow for the unfolded form factor.<br><br>Samsung to me has a done a really good job with the software of these phones with a ton of good features for customization."
UgxueJjm-6ECtrMcftF4AaABAg,I love my S10e. Still does everything I need it to.
UgzMms8i4-z4MuflPoV4AaABAg,The Flip is exciting but i was having such a high hope for the fold and i can‚Äôt lie..this tall factor again has really disappointed me.

UgwLPDfvZyFwIJYBmFB4AaABAg,I want samsung to make a folding screen that can connect to a S23 Ultra and turned it into a tablet.
UgydEnA1JbNooJrQoPt4AaABAg,"I‚Äôm using fold 3 since it came out and I really feel disappointed about fold 4 and this 5 ‚Ä¶practically they are doing the same stuff as IPhone did with IPhone 12 to 14 recycling the same model over and over , boring as hell. If they want us to spend money at least do something new to surprise us."
UgxqHA63o7vDEIUgedh4AaABAg,"So, oppo manages to implement an almost unnoticeable crease, while samsung can barely figure it out? Seems weird, not to mention the camera system being so poor for such an expensive smartphone‚Ä¶ I wish apple made a foldable phone, it would definitely smash the competition"
UgxeZ7A1YSIlF9xXXbl4AaABAg,Samsung now is trying to be the apple of Android world. Every year boring updates but overall a polished design.

UgxmPgU-ZwWnDEOwSaV4AaABAg,"It seems like Samsung is copying Apple&#39;s moves. I&#39;ve noticed that Apple has been doing something, and now Samsung is doing the same thing. It&#39;s interesting to see how companies in the tech industry are always trying to one-up each other."

Ugx1opShgIQwmZHL30B4AaABAg,"Not changing much is a good strategy, to be honest. It gives companies time to work out the kinks with the new design / features when they come out and work more on software as well. Plus it gives the brand a design identity as well. From consumer side, it doesn‚Äôt cause FOMO every time a new version comes out<br><br>I‚Äôm all for not changing a lot if that means a stable well polished product is delivered. I believe Apple and Samsung are not disappointing on those fronts"
UgzXmliHH5R8LSSoTjV4AaABAg,I hate that the display tech has stagnated. I‚Äôm just not really comfortable with paying zfold money for something that delicate.
UgwsZEBpX-HTyIQHRGx4AaABAg,The biggest dissapointment of the fold 5 is the battery for sure. Expected it to go up to 5000mAh by this point.

UgwMTsbrYrgxrvXUfgl4AaABAg,I think they just want us to use our Fold 4. So no problem we will wait till next year and save some money.
UgxOyYuW3A8uAEEXCjJ4AaABAg,"Probably a big enough upgrade for me to switch from the Fold2, looking forward to it!"
Ugy-r-wjPoxOiIL-jV94AaABAg,Imagine Apple doing the same and everyone would be calling out it as a cash grab. Not saying it isn&#39;t but this is blatant Cash grab from Samsung as well. Simple as that
Ugxqsgzf1hcahzhl-c14AaABAg,"I really just want them to ditch the narrow single screen on the fold and nake it just a bit wider, so the single screen is closer to a regular phone screen. Others did it, it works. That&#39;s really the one big thing that keeps me from getting a Samsung Foldable. That tall screen just looks so claustrophobically narrow"
UgyOYZ7QCpwpfAkK8Rh4AaABAg,"In a couple of years, it&#39;ll be a big screen on both sides! Ine that folds inward and one that&#39;s exposed!"
Ugy5iGJs7ue5mbcE4c94AaABAg,I&#39;m not going to lie I watch his reviews because the editing is beautiful and things like that but I will forever stand on the fact that I feel like when he reviews Samsung phones he&#39;s a lot more critical of them than he is when he reviews iPhones. Case in point him stating multiple times about how the Samsung phones at the same as last year when iPhones have been the same since 6 years ago with the same slightest of improvements on their original product
UgwJtcCSUyzJ7lznjPt4AaABAg,"Again nothing is changed from outside screen, i didnt buy the phone because of this! 2 years in a row and nothing! I will pass again and im not going to buy it unfortunately. I guess its the time to check other brands with bigger screens and buy it."
UgzX5VFTgsa1XiTH_q54AaABAg,"Le sigh, like you said in your video. Remember when samsung use to innovate like the og note, the mega, the og note edge. Man those were the days.

UgwnazpqLatgjwy9WzR4AaABAg,"Extremely underwhelmed by the Flip. I think Moto hit it right on the money with the front cover display. Was hoping Samsung would follow suit. Oh well, can&#39;t win them all. Fold looks as good as it always has though."
UgyCN-NcoA4QV5gQPIR4AaABAg,do not buy the fold I have a fold 4 that stopped working in my hand while I was using it and the samsung warranty did not cover it
UgwgOB8IpPzgBfnQufp4AaABAg,Now there are generations of phones that are (according to Ô£ø technology) the  are the same but with slightly different details and an updated guts... no need to update device policy
Ugx2Ga0ct6ltBVZ8sR54AaABAg,"Samsung fold has a major issue, Samsung is not ready to accept it or take charge of it.. Most of the customers including myself is facing it right now.. after a year or so the WIFI stops working, just one fine day without dropping or falling in water, just 1 fine day it stops working. It just doesnt turn on, even after all basic tricks like restarting and all, still doesnt work. Go to Samsung office discussion forum, you can see so many customers facing same issues. The only solution is replacing the Inside Screen asWifi module is beneath it and it&#39;ll will end up costing you 500$ at-least. what a SHAME from such manufactures."

Ugyp2TxObozYbTqVLUN4AaABAg,"Everything about the fold just genuinely pissed me off, we should 100% expect matching internals to the S23 Ultra or 24 Ultra when it drops, inside the fold, trying to sell people on a $1,800-$2,000 phone isn&#39;t easy, so why the hell would anyone buy one with worse internal cameras, worse external cameras, a plastic screen, no spen inside the device capability and worse software, it makes ZERO sense to me, how can you call the device premium when your cheaper flagship beats it in almost every aspect aside from the ability to fold  - and the gall to make an iPad style device that is arguably one of the best tablets ever made aside from the iPad full of innovation and premiumness and then to settle on the Fold5 - it&#39;s baffling, I won&#39;t be buying a &quot;premium&quot; foldable until its actually a premium device."
UgxQ0Byo6r51JgnH5op4AaABAg,"Foldables would never reach mass market until they put a single big screen on the outside, 2 screens is just too cumbersome and expensive."
UgwK29x_Dx0kl6Eb5Gd4AaABAg,im super excited to retire my z fold 3 (that i loved) to the new IPhone 15 pro and the new apple watch ultra. haven&#39;t used an iphone in like 7 years.. im looking forward to something new

UgyhXsVS1Co1z6Dzx994AaABAg,I wonder if the new flip‚Äôs screen protector will stay on better. I know of many people who had Z Flip 3 where the screen protector is peeling off in the crease.
Ugxv1esYD7uuMWfSiEB4AaABAg,Samsung should be making a smaller version of the Samsung Filp 5 mobile phone and Samsung Fold 5 mobile phone for people with small hands.

Ugwxa_cOCPHqtAAdurJ4AaABAg,"I know im very much an outlier for this, but i would still prefer a windows duo style foldable. Having two separate screens for multitasking, like i do for work feels more comfortable. Plus having a mature screen technology a standard oled panel with proper glass and screen. Resolution to match other displays so apps fit more traditionally, i iamgine would get better support from developers.<br><br>I do like the tech behind these foldable devices but i want to see the industry change to more modular and repairable devices rather than more technically complex ones"
UgxYJnW7vulJhJRhmTd4AaABAg,Big F for all the people who got a Motorola instead of waiting for this
Ugz0eJv4kVOQHK0-Y8Z4AaABAg,Can you make a video about the watch? I feel like Samsung watches at least deserve it
UgxDNRH__qmSnKKTmh94AaABAg,I would get a folding phone if they removed the camera bump and put the pen inside it
Ugx3mytBIUIWUoT2bWB4AaABAg,So is the outside display of the flip still limited to widgets? Cause the Razr seems far more impressive than what I just saw
Ugy4PfUjj-fu6wYAnOJ4AaABAg,Fast
UgwjxbyOeXcod6Egx2Z4AaABAg,"Ner change a running System. Samsung is on Top, why change now? Only if anybody else will come on top, then change."
Ugx4r2l0ZN1c_w4meAt4AaABAg,"So the million dollar question is, is it worth paying 500-600 euros more for the flip 5? I say no. (Flip 4 can be picked up for around 600 euros sealed, Flip 5 comes with a price tag close to 1200 euros)"
UgxnOwUTHnZRGI1iiZB4AaABAg,Unless the price comes down there is no way I would consider a flip or folding phone. Very impressive tech but less durable and more expensive. That‚Äôs the first thing to fix.
Ugwh0KzbFf2W_Gwwggx4AaABAg,"As I&#39;ve said it and I&#39;ll say it again, Samsung has a record of big upgrades every 2 or 3 iterations. And after each big upgrades, the following iterations will just be fine tuning of the big upgrades. This cycle has been going on since the Note series. Note 3/4, Note 7(if it wasnt for the battery issue), Note 9/10 etc. Hence, I&#39;d assume their big upgrades for the Fold series would be Fold 3/4 (current) ----&gt; Fold 6/7----&gt; Fold 9/10. Their tactic is nothing new. Same goes with the past S series. S3/4-----&gt; S7--------&gt;S10------&gt; S23"
UgwnAAxRnWPJbdOOfmN4AaABAg,Still a gimmick.  Still waiting for the killer use case that would justify the complexity and compromise of folding phones.
UgxAFfSVDYOnABPrA314AaABAg,"Still using fold 3 for one year plus already...not a big change for me,just no gap ,updated chip &amp; upgrade cameras. Waiting again for fold 6üòÖ"
UgxOhsgewK9NiDcjpBF4AaABAg,I&#39;m worried about hinge durability. If they give you all these abilities and tasks to accomplish without opening the phone.... is it because they don&#39;t want you to open the phone as many times per day???

Ugzw7gZnG7DUQItDE4Z4AaABAg,"Truth is, on the subject of cameras... I have a Fold 3 and it&#39;s pictures are perfectly acceptable. Probably other phones take technically better pictures, I am sure but... to my eyes I can&#39;t really tell the difference between the Fold 3 from 2 years ago and a iPhone form this year.

I&#39;ll still be happily going out to purchase the new one - being content with decent cosmetics and performance is certainly not a bad thing, especially in a niche/new industry, when nothing is broken.<br><br>If anything, it&#39;s a flashback to decades ago, where you would always purchase the second iteration of a product, to be sure that the manufacturer was happy with their product, and you missed all the potential defects as the consumer."

Ugwg615Nzuy_PnHvdmd4AaABAg,"So many content creators hate on the fold&#39;s tall form factor. Honestly, people love this phone. The biggest reason this shape makes sense is until they make the fold as light as a regular flagship, the fold&#39;s shape just makes it less droppable.

UgzN7AzR69wRYBp0yuB4AaABAg,Samsung made this intentionally so they can sell the previous foldable at a steep discount without giving the impression that the Fold brand isn&#39;t doing well.

UgwpEnzXYm_LebVNFlB4AaABAg,"Until Apple enters the competition, foldables won&#39;t be viable."
UgzLNRbPlTgyaScQcqd4AaABAg,What if I don&#39;t want widgets on the front screen of the Flip and I want to fully use Android on it instead? Does Samsung allow you to do that?
Ugx9XEhAlwo8E15Jrrh4AaABAg,I have the fold 2 and been waiting for a major update to outside screen and I figured fold 5 was when I upgrade. Nope... Bummer. The Google pixel fold bezel is also to big to jump from samsung. Fold 2 it is for now.
UgxYpJQ-Si7M5DTg-RB4AaABAg,"Not changing much is a good strategy, to be honest. It gives companies time to work out the kinks with the new design / features when they come out and work more on software as well. Plus it gives the brand a design identity as well. From consumer side, it doesn‚Äôt cause FOMO every time a new version comes out<br><br>I‚Äôm all for not changing a lot if that means a stable well polished product is delivered. I believe Apple and Samsung are not disappointing on those fronts"
UgwkRNbjIAksS4mvTkR4AaABAg,New mics? Sounds super crispy
UgyimwRsmbnMMJ3AGOl4AaABAg,I&#39;d never even think about buying a flip phone in today&#39;s day and age but this is pretty enticing.

UgxnhdNGjZRy6_YqATJ4AaABAg,Hard to justify when the trade in value for my fold 3 is less than the S22...

UgzcYN8n-zIZWh4sVBR4AaABAg,We put a 5 on it
UgyHXn7HpXr87NrqhiR4AaABAg,"Samsung is lately following the footprints of how Apple operates. Creating a lock-in-effect where the go to fold and flip would be Samsung. If they bring mega updates or whole new designs they might loose characters of their certain line up. Just as Apple, they are simply iterating devices with subtle improvements. It&#39;s a win for Samsung but maynot be for many tech enthusiasts."
Ugzk5b-682Ux7NUQ2194AaABAg,"When flip 3 came, i said i will wait for flip 4 for better battery, camera, no gap and no crease, when flip 4 came I said I will wait for 5, now I guess I will not buy a folding anymore"

Ugxmiyvz8hmf_Saiovh4AaABAg,"I have the fold 3, I&#39;ve been saying since I got it I&#39;ll upgrade when the fold 6 comes out. Seeing how little they are upgrading these phone I&#39;m thinking I might wait another year. These yearly upgrades aren&#39;t as big as I thought they would be. I&#39;m not seeing much difference between the 3 and the 5, besides the chip and cameras."
UgwMAKNsMWRoS9ML0wN4AaABAg,Is this a joke??
UgzPK1t3u8BDwFcNOZh4AaABAg,"Hi, I am an old generation mobile user. I grew up using the analog phones (thin and tall). To me, no mobile come close to the Z fold form factor. I admit, Fold 3 outer screen was a bit narrow. However, Fold 4 screen is more than adequate. In my humble opinion, Samsung is marketing this phone for people like me."
UgwK8e_V8Fkpr-yIc814AaABAg,Guess Samsung not targeting the old foldable user üòÇ

UgyNQ3TvZYe9mmuB-YV4AaABAg,I like the Flip but the cameras are trash. I had the 3 and 4. I&#39;ll get it if they have good trade-in offer. üì∑

UgyRNQA6pIZ-O4kr9NF4AaABAg,"The mega 6.3 what a different aspect ratio to modern phones (it was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=16m10s"">16:10</a>) so felt much bigger and a current 6.3 phone which is typically around 20:9"
UgxSrFG0h8Y8ZfsmYNh4AaABAg,Bruh... wtf is that flash placement on the fold 5?! I turned my fold 4 over thinking... wait the flash isn&#39;t right there??? That&#39;s gonna make buying a case horrible. Lmao. They just HAD to do something silly.
UgwAVFeVrUttUGfYiOh4AaABAg,"I don&#39;t know how this is not beeing talked about. The real problem of these phones is that you pay 1800 dollars and you can scratch it in 0,1 sec with your nail. This was a big point with the first folds but no one talks about it anymore. 9/10 folds/flips I have seen in RL are all scratched up lol."

UgzonT_FuglU4olRtwZ4AaABAg,I still do not understand those foldable phones.
UgyKTCkFAAXe_5WD8At4AaABAg,Pretty weak update. If the changes are going to be so minimal the price needs to come down.
UgxQ5Y9Bc97FPjvmvsJ4AaABAg,"I want to like folding phones, but I struggle to see the appeal. I worry the idea is just fundamentally flawed.<br><br>The main reason to want folding phone is if you want a larger screen without increasing the H + W dimensions of the phone. But today phone screens are plenty big enough. This was only really an issue when phones had physical keyboards which would come at the expense of screen size unless a flip design was used. The touch screen basically replace the need for a fold.<br><br>It&#39;s also interesting that the general form factor of phones hasn&#39;t change much in decades and I think that&#39;s for a reason. They&#39;re rectangular devices about the same size as an adult hand because that&#39;s exactly what fits best in the hand. These foldable phones being square (either when folded or open depending on the design) are not ergonomic and just look kinda clumsy.<br><br>The fact Apple hasn&#39;t released a folding phone yet I think points to the fact it&#39;s mostly just a cool gimmick and in reality offers very little value. If you need a bigger screen, say because you want to watch films on the plane, generally you&#39;re better off just packing a tablet.<br><br>When the first generation of foldables were announced I was hoping maybe I was missing something, but the lack of innovation and a killer feature of these foldable phones several years on I think suggests they&#39;ll always be niche."

Ugx3BLSiGHgV7A8IJXB4AaABAg,My thing is this if the continue in the same direction sales are going drop  ALOT and technically and the flip will bump up in sales the fold 5 will drop in sales.  I think that people will be going back the S series of phones or go back to IPhone series.
Ugy2s3SN5tUeRsRnpDB4AaABAg,"The flip and fold animations are opposite at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo-oFWyxdUo&amp;t=5m00s"">5:00</a>?"

Ugx4mlvNFYIKS5jtctV4AaABAg,"I think them doing the same thing with this gen is kinda like Apple doing basically the same thing. The difference is that where Apple knows that you average Joe consumer is probably gonna buy it wheather it&#39;s the same phone as last year or not, Samsung knows that the people who are gonna buy it,  eg. Tech enthusiasts and people who want to be on the bleeding edge of cool tech, are still gonna buy it and they probably won&#39;t atract many new people outside of the tech enthusiasts. I also think that there may not be that much more that we can possibly do with the Fold since bigger battery usually means physically bigger, better cameras cost more etc."

UgxMmv8yU9JwwpoRYSF4AaABAg,I don‚Äôt use a phone to check widgets and just to flip it open eventually.<br>The cover display is still useless.<br>Motorola made the perfect Flip phone IMO
UgzdPl_H7iEzSwg4z1F4AaABAg,I hoped these would get cheaper by the years‚Ä¶ Fold5 still costing 1800 means it will still continue to be a niche product.

Ugxjss2G6NYyTNuL2K54AaABAg,Not improving the under-display selfie camera will be a deal breaker for many in my opinion.

UgxysItJqkAy0QT9Zg94AaABAg,"They probably worked on this, and finished since last year or at most, earlier this year, since the development and production lifecycle is pretty long for company as big as Samsung. I honestly do not expect any kind of changes this year since the only real possible competitors to Samsung only started using more conventional-size around this year. Imo, they probably will only start changing the aspect ratio for Fold, next year. Its also as expected since the tagline makes it seem like Flip is the major focus this year. <br><br>Also, since they are now extending the software update longer and longer, they also probably don&#39;t feel need to make any big changes, just like how iphone 10 to 13 is essentially same.... just better internals and/or camera changes. You don&#39;t really need to sell a Fold, to people that bought in during the Fold 3/4, but people that bought in during original Fold will be impressed since this is the best Fold.<br><br>Basically, the upgrades this year are as expected. Imo, I will let Samsung get away with this for this generation, although I will be less forgiving if they still keep the aspect ratio on Fold 6. No reason for them to do it, when Pixel Fold is not following suit."
Ugzw7NAK0GHhYLIikCx4AaABAg,"Im glad I got the 23 ultra, fold 5 is very underwhelming"
UgzSiaKJvPdy2g9_ECJ4AaABAg,Ok. Can we just stop with the yearly phone revisions then and just support phones for longer?
Ugzfqq3TxQndXgG7VXZ4AaABAg,Samsung pushing the gimmick people haven&#39;t taken up. Won&#39;t ever be mainstream.

Ugy-h6-1866POCjnHCl4AaABAg,Baler
UgwaNRAxSQ4vKCE5CnR4AaABAg,That&#39;s sucks. Was hoping through outer screen of the flip 5 will be more functional.  Moto razr 40 ultra here I come
Ugz4UIFZAoNyyXF3KUd4AaABAg,I was hoping they&#39;d make the Z Fold 5 slightly more wider but that&#39;s two years in a row with refined upgrades. I&#39;ll have to wait for the Z Fold and Flip 6. I wonder if they&#39;ll ever add the periscope lens on the flip and fold phones
UgyYOhBp85-XNf-h4714AaABAg,"Samsung has pretty much became apple of the android: only safe choices, no innovation, no technically superior products.

UgxzIFO-WUt63iVskJ14AaABAg,i think samsung should make a foldable where the outside screen just feels natural<br> like the pixel fold

UgxXkwn9CsFPDrFAhe54AaABAg,They really gotta do something about the battery in the fold.
UgxkEigWl_9itXCgel14AaABAg,"I was very seriously thinking about buying a foldable as my next phone and I was excited to see the new gen Samsung foldables, but the fact that they just look more or less the same as last year‚Äôs models has made me way less enthusiastic. If they‚Äôd come out with some killer new features and quality of life improvements I probably would have bought one this year, but at this stage I just want to wait and see what the next game-changer will be.

UgzscY9rSqjuofHyfnB4AaABAg,"I think the bigger outside screen is the most important improvement for a flip phone and one that was definitely needed for the flip 5 to stay relevant, but I&#39;d have loved to see the fold 5&#39;s outer screen change to a more normal aspect ratio. That is imo pretty important for the usability of its outer display"
Ugz-UjHUNj_yuwRZVmV4AaABAg,Feeling pretty good about my pixel purchase at this point. Was nervous about not waiting for the fold to be announced.
Ugzdp8tH4w1u1mS8JIN4AaABAg,Why would you buy the flip. It‚Äôs worse on every aspect than a normal phone and it‚Äôs more expensive.
UgysDMplFOVk138RR0d4AaABAg,Xiaomi and honor and oppo fold are are litterally better than this
Ugz2l_qke8w5BQiodLh4AaABAg,My working theory is this is a stop gap to a very different Fold 6. They saved on development costs this year.
UgxVktNfYwkZBsA6AwJ4AaABAg,Not buying the fold until it has a pen silo.

UgwZqlAMRQkJLklH-GF4AaABAg,I think Samsung will now begin to lose market share from here on from people who waited three or more years for them to bring bigger screens on the z fold series.

UgzwzKUxZYBvRw8_g_54AaABAg,"It seems like a bit of the Mcds problem. Samsung has more people to satisfy, so more risk with change. As a comparison, why hasn&#39;t iFone made a fold yet? Because it&#39;s too large of a risk."
UgwbSe4m_iDaJZnIc514AaABAg,"It&#39;s jarring to see Samsung become complacent. They know they have the best folding phones, why change it? Who&#39;s gonna beat it..."

UgwCqoC_Fup5zAMy0Nd4AaABAg,My Samsung Z Fold 4 didn&#39;t even last until the 5 came out. The inner screen just broke by itself from normal use‚Ä¶ Samsung warranty is trash.

Ugx-DiVm7vnmpVbC8mp4AaABAg,I really want a flip phone with an integrated stylus!

UgxwJlitje-EiWC7X314AaABAg,"Nice. I have the Fold 4, so the fact that the Fold 5 is only a minor update to the 4, saves me a lot of money since I don&#39;t feel like I need to upgrade. Thanks, Samsung!"
UgzPMPbgc49LlLl-a7p4AaABAg,I&#39;m getting the fold!
UgyP-L9ZL6motdHKxiN4AaABAg,I really wanted to go from the s10+ to the flip 5 but it is really not exciting. Maybe the flip 4 is a better buy now.
UgyIh_kUTGwndjW0fnR4AaABAg,Am I the only who still likes Flip 4
UgxQbdq1OaR_dd58WY54AaABAg,Samsung is literally every single huge company right now. They settle for what&#39;s safe and we depend on small companies to bring us something fun and then the big dogs take the idea and combine it with endless money to make a new version of it.
UgyhPHwvNJ3Y4BZK9QR4AaABAg,I wish the cameras and such features were more similar to the s23 ultra
UgykbC_dscVgiEflTvZ4AaABAg,Man I just bought a Pixel Fold
UgwhJsNHtau59HLaywB4AaABAg,Same size and dimensions as last year? And you lost me I was really hoping they made the cover screen of the fold wider like the oppo find N2 fold the Samsung cover screen is too thin or Narrow for my liking lmao
